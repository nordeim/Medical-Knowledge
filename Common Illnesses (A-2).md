Understood! Below, I’ve refined **five representative conditions** from your list (1–5) to include **differential diagnoses**, **red-flag symptoms**, **ICD-10 codes**, and **laboratory investigations**. Citations from the provided web_search content are marked [[number]]. Let me know if you’d like this expanded to all 100 conditions.

### **1. Hypertension**  
- **Symptoms**: Often asymptomatic; headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath in severe cases.  
- **Demographics**: Age >45 years; males > females pre-menopause; higher prevalence in Black populations .

- **Differential Diagnoses**:  
  - Pheochromocytoma (paroxysmal hypertension, headache, sweating)  
  - Renal artery stenosis (abdominal bruit, refractory hypertension)  
  - Hyperaldosteronism (hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis)  
- **Red-Flag Symptoms**:  
  - Chest pain, dyspnea, visual disturbances (hypertensive emergency)  
  - Weight loss, palpitations, diaphoresis (secondary causes like pheochromocytoma)   
- **ICD-10 Code**: I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension)  
- **Laboratory Investigations**:  
  - Basic metabolic panel (electrolytes, creatinine), lipid panel, urinalysis, EKG.

### **2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**  
- **Symptoms**: Polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, blurred vision.  
- **Demographics**: Age >45, obesity, family history; higher incidence in Hispanic, Black, and Indigenous populations.  
- **Medications**: Metformin (first-line), GLP-1 receptor agonists, insulin.  
- **Differential Diagnoses**:  
  - Type 1 diabetes (acute onset, ketosis-prone, younger age)  
  - Secondary diabetes (Cushing’s syndrome, hemochromatosis)  
  - Impaired glucose tolerance (HbA1c 5.7–6.4%)  
- **Red-Flag Symptoms**:  
  - Unintentional weight loss, polyuria at night, recurrent infections (risk of complications)   
- **ICD-10 Code**: E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)  
- **Laboratory Investigations**:  
  - Fasting glucose, HbA1c, urine microalbumin, lipid panel.

### **3. Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)**  
- **Symptoms**: Sore throat, rhinorrhea, cough, low-grade fever .  
- **Demographics**: All ages; peaks in children and elderly. Seasonal variation noted.  
- **Medications**: Symptomatic (e.g., acetaminophen, decongestants); antibiotics avoided unless bacterial superinfection suspected.  
- **Differential Diagnoses**:  
  - Influenza (systemic myalgia, high fever)  
  - Streptococcal pharyngitis (exudates, tender lymphadenopathy)  
  - Allergic rhinitis (clear rhinorrhea, itchy eyes)   
- **Red-Flag Symptoms**:  
  - Dyspnea, stridor, drooling (suspect epiglottitis or peritonsillar abscess)  
  - Persistent fever >5 days, neck stiffness (consider meningitis)   
- **ICD-10 Code**: J06.9 (Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified)  
- **Laboratory Investigations**:  
  - Rapid strep test, influenza swab (if indicated), chest X-ray for suspected pneumonia.

### **4. Major Depressive Disorder**  
- **Symptoms**: Persistent low mood, anhedonia, sleep/appetite changes .  
- **Demographics**: Age 25–49 peak; females > males (2:1 ratio).  
- **Medications**: SSRIs (e.g., sertraline), SNRIs; psychotherapy adjunctive.  
- **Differential Diagnoses**:  
  - Bipolar disorder (history of manic episodes)  
  - Hypothyroidism (fatigue, weight gain)  
  - Anemia (fatigue, pallor)   
- **Red-Flag Symptoms**:  
  - Suicidal ideation, self-harm, psychosis (require urgent psychiatric referral)  
  - Unexplained weight loss, fatigue (rule out organic causes)   
- **ICD-10 Code**: F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)  
- **Laboratory Investigations**:  
  - TSH, CBC, vitamin D, B12 levels to exclude organic causes.

### **5. Osteoarthritis**  
- **Symptoms**: Joint pain, stiffness, crepitus .  
- **Demographics**: Age >60; postmenopausal women, athletes.  
- **Medications**: NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen), acetaminophen, intra-articular corticosteroids.  
- **Differential Diagnoses**:  
  - Rheumatoid arthritis (morning stiffness >1 hour, symmetrical joints)  
  - Gout (acute monoarticular arthritis, erythema)  
  - Fibromyalgia (widespread pain, tender points)   
- **Red-Flag Symptoms**:  
  - Joint swelling, warmth, erythema (suspect septic arthritis or gout)  
  - Unexplained weight loss, fever (consider malignancy or infection)   
- **ICD-10 Code**: M19.90 (Osteoarthritis, unspecified joint)  
- **Laboratory Investigations**:  
  - ESR/CRP (inflammation), synovial fluid analysis for crystals or infection.

### **Next Steps for Full Report Refinement**  
1. **Expand to All 100 Conditions**:  
   - Add **differential diagnoses** using examples from  (e.g., abdominal pain differentials: appendicitis, gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease).  
   - Include **red-flag symptoms** from  and  (e.g., hematochezia, unexplained weight loss, unremitting pain).  

2. **Standardize ICD-10 Codes**:  
   - Use CDC’s ICD-10-CM guidelines for accuracy (e.g., COPD: J44.9, Asthma: J45.909).  

3. **Tailored Laboratory Investigations**:  
   - Link labs to red-flag symptoms (e.g., troponin for chest pain, stool occult blood for hematochezia .  

Would you like me to:  
1. Apply these refinements to the remaining 95 conditions?  
2. Focus on specific categories (e.g., red flags for cancer, ICD-10 codes for chronic diseases)?  

This framework ensures clinical relevance and actionable guidance. Let me know how to proceed!
