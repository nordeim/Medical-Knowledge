General practitioners are diagnosticians, counselors, chronic disease managers, and pillars of community health, often managing a remarkable breadth of conditions in a single day. This diversity is one of the greatest strengths of general practice, but it also presents a unique challenge: the need for a vast, readily accessible, and constantly evolving knowledge base encompassing a wide array of potential patient presentations.

The transition from structured medical training to the independent practice of general medicine can feel both exhilarating and daunting. While your foundational medical education has provided you with critical principles and diagnostic approaches, the sheer volume and variety of conditions encountered in daily practice necessitate continuous learning and quick access to reliable information. Patients present not as isolated cases of rare diseases, but most frequently with common ailments, often with overlapping symptoms or complex interactions with existing health issues. Mastering the identification and initial management of these high-prevalence conditions is paramount to building confidence, providing effective care, and ensuring positive patient outcomes.

It is with this understanding that this comprehensive report has been compiled. Acting as a dedicated co-medical assistant, this document is designed to serve as a well-researched and systematically organized reference guide to the **top 100 most common illnesses** typically encountered in a general practitioner's practice. The selection of these conditions is based on extensive research into prevalence data, common reasons for primary care visits, and the clinical experience reflected in medical literature and public health data. The goal is to provide you with a structured resource that supports your clinical reasoning, helps validate your diagnostic considerations, and offers guidance on commonly employed management strategies in the primary care setting.

The process of generating this report involved a deep and systematic exploration of available medical information. Drawing upon a broad knowledge base and conducting extensive simulated web searches for updated medical information, I have aimed to synthesize key data points for each condition. The sheer volume of medical knowledge is immense, and distilling it down to the most pertinent information for a primary care context requires careful deliberation and a focus on practical application.

For each of the 100 common illnesses included in this report, you will find a dedicated section detailing three critical areas:

1.  **Common Symptoms (Helpful for Diagnosis):** This section focuses on the typical signs and symptoms that patients present with in primary care. Recognizing these common patterns is often the first step in formulating a differential diagnosis. While symptom presentation can vary, understanding the most frequent manifestations provides a crucial starting point for clinical assessment.
2.  **Affected Demographic (Typical Age, Gender, and Race):** Understanding the typical demographic profile of a condition can significantly narrow down the diagnostic possibilities. This section outlines the age groups, genders, and sometimes racial or ethnic groups that are disproportionately affected, alongside key risk factors associated with the illness. Knowing who is most likely to develop a particular condition can inform your suspicion and investigation.
3.  **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** This part provides an overview of the standard pharmacological treatments used in primary care for the management of the condition. It lists frequently prescribed drug classes and examples, offering a practical guide to initial treatment approaches. It is important to note that treatment guidelines evolve, and patient-specific factors, comorbidities, and potential drug interactions must always be considered when making prescribing decisions.

The structure of the report, presenting each illness in its own section with these consistent details, is intended to facilitate quick lookups and systematic review. As you encounter patients in your practice, you can refer to this document to reinforce your understanding of common presentations, confirm demographic associations, and review standard treatment options.

It is crucial to emphasize that this report is a tool designed to augment, not replace, your medical expertise and clinical judgment. Medicine is an art and a science that requires integrating information from various sources – the patient's history, your physical examination findings, diagnostic tests, and your own evolving clinical experience. The information presented here represents common scenarios; individual patients may deviate from typical presentations, have multiple co-existing conditions, or require individualized treatment plans that fall outside the most common approaches.

Furthermore, the field of medicine is constantly advancing. New research, updated guidelines, and emerging treatments continually shape best practices. Use this report as a living document – a foundation upon which to build your knowledge through ongoing learning, consulting evidence-based guidelines, discussing cases with colleagues, and seeking specialist advice when appropriate.

Consider this report your initial systematic exploration of the primary care landscape, a distilled compendium of the conditions you will encounter most frequently. It is here to support your deep thinking, provide a safety net of readily accessible information, and partner with you as a co-medical assistant in your daily practice. May it serve you well as you navigate the complexities and fulfill the vital role of a general practitioner in the health of your community.

**1. Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Often referred to as the "common cold." Symptoms typically include nasal congestion, runny nose (rhinorrhea), sore throat (pharyngitis), cough, sneezing, headache, malaise, and sometimes a low-grade fever. Symptoms usually develop gradually and resolve within 7-10 days, although cough may persist longer.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Extremely common across all age groups. Children are particularly susceptible due to developing immune systems and close contact in school/daycare settings. Adults experience several colds per year on average. No significant gender or racial predisposition, though environmental factors and exposure play a role.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment is primarily supportive and symptomatic. Antibiotics are *not* effective for viral URTIs.
    *   **Analgesics/Antipyretics:** Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or Ibuprofen for headache, sore throat pain, and fever.
    *   **Decongestants:** Oral (e.g., pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine) or nasal sprays (e.g., oxymetazoline - use limited to a few days to avoid rebound congestion) for nasal congestion.
    *   **Antihistamines:** May help with runny nose and sneezing, especially if allergic components are suspected.
    *   **Cough Suppressants/Expectorants:** Used for symptomatic relief of cough, though evidence of effectiveness varies.

---

**2. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Often asymptomatic ("the silent killer"). When symptoms do occur, they can be non-specific and may include headache, shortness of breath, nosebleeds, or dizziness, but these usually only appear in severe hypertension or hypertensive crises. Diagnosis is typically made through routine blood pressure measurements.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Prevalence increases significantly with age, particularly over 60. More common in men than women before age 55, but more common in women after age 75. Disproportionately affects Black adults, who tend to develop it earlier and more severely. Other risk factors include family history, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, high sodium intake, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment often involves lifestyle modifications first, followed by pharmacological therapy if blood pressure remains elevated. Choice depends on stage of hypertension, presence of comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, heart disease), and patient factors.
    *   **First-line agents often include:**
        *   Thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)
        *   ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril)
        *   ARBs (Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers) (e.g., losartan, valsartan)
        *   Calcium Channel Blockers (e.g., amlodipine, diltiazem)
    *   **Other agents used:** Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, atenolol), Alpha-blockers, combination pills.

---

**3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Often insidious and may be mild or absent in early stages. Symptoms can include increased thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), increased hunger (polyphagia), fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, unexplained weight loss, and recurrent infections (skin, UTIs). Many are diagnosed through routine blood tests (fasting glucose, HbA1c) before symptoms appear.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged and older adults (over 45), but increasingly seen in younger adults, adolescents, and children due to rising obesity rates. More prevalent in certain racial/ethnic groups, including Black Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and some Asian Americans. Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history, history of gestational diabetes, and certain medical conditions.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment starts with lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, weight loss). Pharmacological therapy is often necessary and may involve one or more agents.
    *   **First-line agent:** Metformin.
    *   **Other oral medications:** Sulfonylureas (e.g., glipizide, glyburide), DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin), SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., empagliflozin, canagliflozin), Thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone), GLP-1 receptor agonists (oral forms like semaglutide).
    *   **Injectable medications:** GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide), Insulin (various types - rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting), Amylin analogs (e.g., pramlintide).

**4. Low Back Pain**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Pain and stiffness in the lumbar region of the spine. Can range from a dull ache to sharp or shooting pain. Pain may radiate into the buttocks or legs (sciatica if nerve root is compressed). May be aggravated by movement (bending, lifting) and alleviated by rest. Can be acute (lasting days to weeks) or chronic (lasting 3 months or longer). Associated symptoms can include muscle spasms or limited range of motion. Red flags suggesting more serious causes (e.g., cauda equina syndrome, infection, fracture, malignancy) include fever, unintentional weight loss, new bowel or bladder dysfunction, severe pain not relieved by rest, or neurological deficits.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common across the adult lifespan, particularly between ages 30 and 50. Affects both men and women relatively equally. Risk factors include sedentary lifestyle, heavy lifting, obesity, poor posture, smoking, and certain occupations.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment often focuses on pain management, maintaining activity as tolerated, and physical therapy.
    *   **Over-the-counter (OTC) Analgesics:** Paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen).
    *   **Prescription Analgesics:** Stronger NSAIDs, sometimes muscle relaxants (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine) for short-term use in acute spasms, or in selected cases, short-term opioids (used cautiously due to risks).
    *   **Topical agents:** Creams or patches containing NSAIDs or counterirritants.
    *   **Other:** Neuropathic pain agents (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine) may be considered if there's a significant neuropathic component (like sciatica).

**5. Acute Bronchitis**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Often follows a common cold or viral URTI. The hallmark symptom is a cough, which may initially be dry but often progresses to produce mucus (sputum). Sputum can be clear, white, yellow, or green; the color does *not* reliably indicate a bacterial infection. Other symptoms may include chest soreness or discomfort from coughing, mild shortness of breath, low-grade fever, fatigue, and wheezing. Symptoms typically last 1-3 weeks, but the cough can linger for several weeks.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Common in adults and children. More frequent during cold and flu season. Risk factors include smoking (active or passive), exposure to air pollution or irritants, and recent URTI.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Most cases are viral and do *not* require antibiotics. Treatment is primarily supportive.
    *   **Analgesics/Antipyretics:** Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or Ibuprofen for fever or chest discomfort.
    *   **Cough Suppressants/Expectorants:** May be used for symptom relief, particularly if cough is disruptive (e.g., dextromethorphan, guaifenesin), though evidence is mixed.
    *   **Bronchodilators:** May be prescribed if wheezing is present, particularly in patients with underlying reactive airway disease like asthma or COPD.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Generally *not* indicated unless there is strong clinical suspicion of a bacterial infection (rare in acute bronchitis) or in patients with comorbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) where a bacterial exacerbation is more likely.

**6. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** The most frequent symptoms are heartburn (a burning sensation in the chest, often after eating, which may worsen at night or when lying down) and regurgitation (bringing food or liquid back up into the mouth). Other potential symptoms include chest pain (can mimic heart pain), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), chronic cough, hoarseness, sore throat, nausea, and a feeling of a lump in the throat (globus sensation).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Common in adults, with estimates suggesting 10-20% of the Western population is affected. It can occur at any age, including infants (where it presents more with vomiting and irritability). Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, and certain medications. A hiatal hernia can also increase the risk.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment involves lifestyle changes and medications.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Avoiding lying down for 3 hours after eating, elevating the head of the bed, weight loss, and avoiding trigger foods (e.g., fatty foods, coffee, alcohol, chocolate, acidic or spicy foods) and smoking.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Antacids (for quick, temporary relief).
        *   H2 receptor blockers (e.g., famotidine, ranitidine - though ranitidine has been withdrawn in some regions). Generally less expensive and can be used for mild symptoms or maintenance.
        *   Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (e.g., omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole). More potent acid suppression and often used as first-line therapy for more severe symptoms or esophagitis.
        *   Prokinetics (less commonly used, may help with stomach emptying).

**7. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Symptoms of a lower UTI (bladder infection or cystitis) include painful urination (dysuria), frequent urination, a strong urge to urinate even with an empty bladder, pain or pressure in the lower abdomen or pelvic area, and sometimes bloody or cloudy urine. Upper UTIs (kidney infection or pyelonephritis) are more serious and may include fever, chills, lower back or flank pain, nausea, and vomiting, often in addition to lower UTI symptoms. Symptoms can be vague in the very young and old.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common, accounting for millions of healthcare visits annually. Much more common in women than men between the ages of 20 and 50, due to female anatomy. Incidence increases in older adults, with the female:male ratio decreasing due to factors like prostate enlargement in men. Other risk factors include sexual intercourse, diabetes, obesity, family history, and urinary tract catheterization.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Antibiotics are the primary treatment for bacterial UTIs.
    *   **Commonly used antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs:** Nitrofurantoin, Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), Fosfomycin, Cephalosporins. The duration of treatment varies but a short course (e.g., 3 days) is often sufficient for uncomplicated cases.
    *   Completing the full course of antibiotics is important even if symptoms improve.
    *   Pain relievers like phenazopyridine can help with dysuria but do not treat the infection.
    *   Topical vaginal estrogen may be helpful for postmenopausal women with recurrent UTIs.

---

**8. Osteoarthritis (OA)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** The main symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Pain is typically deep and achy, often worsening with activity and improving with rest. Stiffness may occur after periods of rest (gelling), including morning stiffness that usually lasts less than 30 minutes. Affected joints may have reduced range of motion, crepitus (clicking or grating sound/sensation), and sometimes swelling. OA commonly affects the knees, hips, spine, and small joints in the hands and feet.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common and the leading cause of chronic disability in older adults. Prevalence increases with age, becoming more common after age 40-50. Affects women more than men. Risk factors include older age, female sex, obesity, previous joint injury or overuse, genetics, and certain occupations.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to alleviate pain and improve function, often starting with non-pharmacological approaches.
    *   **Non-pharmacological:** Patient education, exercise (land-based or water-based), weight loss, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and joint unloading. Heat and cold application can also help.
    *   **Pharmacological:**
        *   Analgesics: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is often the first-line for mild OA. NSAIDs (oral or topical) are used for moderate to severe pain.
        *   Intra-articular injections: Corticosteroids can provide short-term relief during flare-ups. Hyaluronic acid injections may provide longer-lasting symptom improvement in the knee.
        *   Supplements: Glucosamine and chondroitin may be used, particularly for moderate to severe knee OA when taken in combination.
    *   **Surgery:** Joint replacement may be considered for severe pain and disability not controlled by other treatments.

---

**9. Depression**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" mood; feelings of hopelessness or pessimism; irritability, frustration, or restlessness; feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, or guilt; loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities (anhedonia); decreased energy or fatigue; difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions; changes in sleep patterns (insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping); changes in appetite or weight; physical symptoms like headaches, digestive problems, or chronic pain that don't have a clear physical cause; and thoughts of death or suicide. Symptoms must be present for at least two weeks for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Can affect people of all ages, including children and adolescents, but often has onset during adulthood. Women are diagnosed with depression more often than men. Various factors contribute, including genetics, brain chemistry, stress, and other medical conditions. Depression often co-occurs with anxiety disorders.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment often involves psychotherapy (talk therapy), medication, or a combination.
    *   **Antidepressants:**
        *   Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram). Often first-line due to effectiveness and generally manageable side effects.
        *   Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine).
        *   Atypical antidepressants (e.g., bupropion, mirtazapine).
        *   Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) (older classes, less commonly used due to side effects and drug interactions, but may be effective in some cases).
    *   The choice of antidepressant depends on the individual's symptoms, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.

---

**10. Anxiety Disorders**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Excessive worry or fear that is intense and persistent, often out of proportion to the actual danger. Symptoms vary depending on the specific type of anxiety disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, phobias). Common symptoms across disorders include feeling nervous, restless, or tense; increased heart rate; rapid breathing (hyperventilation); sweating; trembling; feeling weak or tired; difficulty concentrating; trouble sleeping; gastrointestinal problems; difficulty controlling worry; and the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety. Panic attacks involve sudden episodes of intense fear with physical symptoms like chest pain, palpitations, and a feeling of choking.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders globally, affecting millions. Onset often occurs during childhood or adolescence and continues into adulthood. More women are affected by anxiety disorders than men, although social anxiety disorder is equally common in men and women.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment often involves psychotherapy (especially cognitive behavioral therapy - CBT), medication, or a combination.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Antidepressants (often SSRIs and SNRIs) are frequently used for long-term management of anxiety disorders.
        *   Benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, lorazepam) may be used for short-term relief of severe anxiety symptoms or panic attacks due to their rapid effect, but are generally not recommended for long-term use due to the risk of dependence.
        *   Buspirone (an anti-anxiety medication).
        *   Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) may be used to manage physical symptoms of anxiety, such as palpitations, particularly in social anxiety or performance anxiety.

---

**11. Acute Sinusitis (Rhinosinusitis)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Inflammation of the sinuses and nasal passages. Symptoms often include nasal congestion or blockage, thick nasal discharge (which may be yellow or green), facial pain or pressure (especially around the eyes, forehead, and cheeks, often worse when bending over), reduced sense of smell or taste, headache, cough (often worse at night), sore throat from post-nasal drip, fever, toothache, and bad breath. Acute sinusitis symptoms last less than 4 weeks, while chronic sinusitis lasts longer.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Affects both children and adults. It is a very common reason for primary care visits. Risk factors include recent viral upper respiratory infection (common cold), allergies, nasal polyps, deviated septum, smoking, and exposure to air pollution. More common in females and the highest incidence is between ages 45 to 64 years.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on whether the cause is viral or bacterial. Most cases are viral and do not require antibiotics.
    *   **Symptomatic Treatment (for viral and bacterial):** Rest, adequate fluids, saline nasal irrigation/rinses, warm compresses to the face, over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers (paracetamol, ibuprofen) for pain and fever.
    *   **Decongestants:** Oral decongestants or decongestant nasal sprays (use nasal sprays for only a few days to avoid rebound congestion).
    *   **Nasal Corticosteroid Sprays:** Can help reduce inflammation, particularly useful if allergies are a contributing factor.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Only indicated if there is strong suspicion of a bacterial infection (e.g., symptoms are severe, persist for more than 7-10 days without improvement, or worsen after initial improvement - "double sickening"). Amoxicillin is a common choice. Due to antibiotic resistance concerns, antibiotics are not routinely prescribed for acute sinusitis.

---

**12. Pharyngitis (Sore Throat)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Inflammation of the back of the throat (pharynx), typically resulting in a sore throat, which can range from mild discomfort to severe pain, especially with swallowing. Other symptoms may include fever, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, redness and swelling of the tonsils and pharyngeal walls, and sometimes tonsillar exudate (pus). Symptoms more suggestive of a viral cause (and less likely to be strep throat) include cough, runny nose (coryza), hoarseness, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common, affecting people of all ages. Viral infections are the most frequent cause, but Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial cause, particularly in children aged 5-15 years. GAS pharyngitis is less common in children under 3 and in adults. It is more common in late winter and early spring.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the cause.
    *   **Symptomatic Treatment (for viral and bacterial):** Pain relievers (paracetamol, NSAIDs like ibuprofen) for sore throat and fever. Warm salt water gargles can provide relief.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Indicated for bacterial pharyngitis, primarily GAS pharyngitis, to prevent complications like acute rheumatic fever. Penicillin or amoxicillin are the first-line treatments, usually for a 10-day course. Antibiotics are not effective for viral pharyngitis. Rapid antigen detection tests or throat cultures are used to diagnose GAS pharyngitis.

---

**13. Acute Otitis Media (Middle Ear Infection)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** An infection of the middle ear, often associated with a recent upper respiratory infection. The main symptom is earache (otalgia), which can be severe. Other symptoms, particularly in young children, may be less specific and include irritability, difficulty sleeping, fever, decreased appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. Older children and adults may also experience decreased hearing or a feeling of ear stuffiness. On physical examination (otoscopy), the eardrum may appear bulging, red, or opaque with reduced mobility. Spontaneous rupture of the eardrum with discharge can sometimes occur, which may relieve the pain.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Extremely common in children, especially between 3 months and 3 years of age, due to the anatomy of the eustachian tube. Much less common in adults. Risk factors include young age, daycare attendance, presence of older siblings, family history of ear infections, lack of breastfeeding, use of pacifiers, exposure to secondhand smoke, and certain medical conditions.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment involves pain management and sometimes antibiotics.
    *   **Pain Management:** Oral analgesics (paracetamol, ibuprofen) are the mainstay of treatment for ear pain and fever. Topical ear drops may provide transient relief but should not be used if the eardrum is perforated.
    *   **Antibiotics:** The decision to prescribe antibiotics depends on the child's age, severity of symptoms, and whether the infection is in one or both ears. A "watchful waiting" approach may be appropriate for some children with mild symptoms, as many cases resolve spontaneously. Antibiotics are often recommended for severe illness, children under 2 years old, or those who do not improve after a few days. Amoxicillin is a common initial antibiotic choice.

---

**14. Hyperlipidemia (High Cholesterol)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Typically asymptomatic. High cholesterol itself does not cause symptoms. It is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases like heart attack and stroke, which may present with symptoms. In rare cases of very high cholesterol due to genetic conditions (familial hypercholesterolemia), fatty deposits called xanthomas may be visible under the skin, particularly around tendons or the eyes.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common globally, particularly in Western countries. Prevalence increases with age. Elevated LDL cholesterol is more common in females than males overall, although there are variations among different racial/ethnic groups. Risk factors include genetics, unhealthy diet (high in saturated and trans fats), sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and a family history of premature cardiovascular disease.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment focuses on lifestyle changes and lipid-lowering medications to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Dietary changes (low in saturated and trans fats), regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Statins (e.g., atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin). These are the first-line and most effective drugs for lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular events.
        *   Ezetimibe (cholesterol absorption inhibitor). Can be used alone or in combination with statins.
        *   PCSK9 inhibitors (injectable medications for severe hypercholesterolemia, particularly familial hypercholesterolemia).
        *   Bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine).
        *   Fibrates (e.g., gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) and Niacin (primarily used to lower triglycerides and increase HDL, though their impact on cardiovascular outcomes is less clear than statins).

---

**15. Pneumonia**

*   **Common Symptoms:** An infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include cough (which may produce mucus that is yellow, green, or bloody), fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain (often worse with breathing or coughing), fatigue, and loss of appetite. Symptoms can vary in different age groups; older adults may have fewer or different symptoms, such as confusion or general deterioration, while young children may have rapid breathing, nasal flaring, or grunting noises.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Can affect people of all ages, but is more serious in infants, young children, older adults, and people with underlying health conditions or weakened immune systems. Causes include bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Community-acquired pneumonia is acquired outside of a hospital setting and is the most common type.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the cause and severity.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Used for bacterial pneumonia. The choice of antibiotic depends on the suspected bacteria, patient's age, and health status. Common antibiotics include macrolides (e.g., azithromycin), doxycycline, or fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin). Hospitalization may be required for more severe cases.
    *   **Antiviral Medications:** Used for viral pneumonia caused by viruses like influenza.
    *   **Antifungal Medications:** Used for fungal pneumonia.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Rest, fluids, oxygen therapy (if needed), and medications for fever and cough.

---

**16. Headaches**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Pain in any region of the head or face, which can vary in location, intensity, and quality (e.g., throbbing, dull ache, sharp pain). Headaches are broadly classified as primary (not caused by an underlying medical condition) or secondary (caused by an underlying condition).
    *   **Tension Headaches:** The most common type. Often described as a band-like tightness or pressure around the head, or a dull ache on both sides of the head or in the back of the head and neck. Usually mild to moderate in severity and not typically associated with nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound. Can be episodic or chronic.
    *   **Migraine Headaches:** Often characterized by moderate to severe throbbing or pulsating pain, usually on one side of the head. Can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia). Some people experience an aura (visual disturbances or other sensory changes) before a migraine. Migraines can be disabling and last for hours to several days.
    *   **Cluster Headaches:** Less common but very severe. Characterized by intense, piercing or stabbing pain, typically located around or behind one eye or on one side of the face. Attacks occur in clusters over a period of weeks or months, sometimes multiple times a day. May be associated with symptoms on the affected side, such as a watery eye, nasal congestion, runny nose, eyelid swelling, or a droopy eyelid. People with cluster headaches often feel restless or agitated during an attack.
    *   **Medication Overuse Headaches:** Can occur in people who frequently use pain relievers for headaches. Can resemble tension headaches or migraines and often occur daily or nearly daily.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Affects people of all ages, races, and genders. Tension headaches and migraines are more common in women than men. Cluster headaches are more common in men. Headaches are a frequent reason for seeking medical care.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment varies depending on the type and frequency of headaches.
    *   **Acute Treatment (for individual headache episodes):**
        *   OTC analgesics: Paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin) for tension headaches and mild to moderate migraines.
        *   Prescription medications for migraines: Triptans (e.g., sumatriptan, zolmitriptan) are effective for moderate to severe migraines. Ergot alkaloids, antiemetics (for nausea/vomiting).
        *   Prescription medications for cluster headaches: Triptans (often injectable or nasal spray for faster relief), oxygen therapy.
    *   **Preventive Treatment (for frequent or severe headaches):**
        *   Lifestyle modifications: Stress management, regular sleep, exercise, identifying and avoiding triggers (certain foods, caffeine, alcohol).
        *   Medications: Beta-blockers, certain antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline), anti-seizure medications (e.g., topiramate), CGRP inhibitors (newer class of medications for migraine prevention). Verapamil or lithium may be used for cluster headache prevention.
        *   Botulinum toxin A injections for chronic migraine.

**17. Dermatitis (Eczema)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A general term for inflammation of the skin, often characterized by itchiness, redness, and a rash. The appearance can vary depending on the type of dermatitis and whether it is acute or chronic.
    *   **Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema):** A chronic condition often starting in childhood. Causes itchy, dry, inflamed skin, which may be red, pink, purple, brown, or gray depending on skin tone. Can involve oozing, crusting, thickening (lichenification), and scaling. Commonly affects the head and scalp, neck, elbows, behind the knees, and buttocks, but can occur anywhere.
    *   **Contact Dermatitis:** An inflammatory reaction caused by contact with an irritant or allergen. Symptoms include an itchy rash, redness, swelling, blisters (which may ooze), dryness, and cracking in the area of contact. Can also cause burning or stinging sensations.
    *   **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** Affects oily areas of the body like the scalp, face, upper chest, and back. Causes a red, itchy rash with greasy scales (dandruff on the scalp).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Common in people of all ages. Atopic dermatitis often begins in infancy and can persist into adulthood; it is more common in children. Contact dermatitis can occur at any age; irritant contact dermatitis is common in occupations involving frequent exposure to water, soaps, or chemicals. Female sex is a risk factor for contact dermatitis, possibly due to exposure to jewelry and fragrances. Genetic factors and a history of allergies or asthma increase the risk of atopic dermatitis.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to reduce inflammation, itch, and dryness.
    *   **General Care:** Avoiding triggers (irritants, allergens), regular moisturizing with emollients (creams, ointments).
    *   **Topical Medications:**
        *   Topical corticosteroids: Used to reduce inflammation during flares. Available in different strengths; potency depends on the severity and location of the rash.
        *   Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus): Non-steroidal options that help reduce inflammation.
    *   **Systemic Medications (for severe or widespread dermatitis):**
        *   Oral corticosteroids (for short-term use in severe flares).
        *   Antihistamines (e.g., hydroxyzine, cetirizine) to help with itching.
        *   Immunosuppressants or biologics (for severe, refractory atopic dermatitis).
    *   **Other:** Medicated shampoos (for seborrheic dermatitis). Wet wraps may be used for severe atopic dermatitis flares.

---

**18. Acne Vulgaris**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A chronic skin condition resulting from clogged hair follicles. Presents with a variety of lesions, primarily on the face, neck, chest, and back (areas with many oil glands). Lesions include:
    *   **Non-inflammatory:** Blackheads (open comedones) and whiteheads (closed comedones).
    *   **Inflammatory:** Red bumps (papules), pus-filled bumps (pustules), deeper and often painful lumps (nodules and cysts).
    *   May also result in oily skin, darkened spots after lesions clear (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), and scarring. Can have significant psychological impact.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Extremely common, particularly during adolescence and young adulthood, affecting the majority of people at some point. Can also occur in infants and adults (adult acne is more common in females). Susceptibility is largely genetic. Other factors include hormonal changes (especially during puberty), oily skin, certain medications, and possibly diet.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the severity and type of lesions. A combination of treatments is often used.
    *   **Topical Medications (applied to the skin):**
        *   Topical retinoids (e.g., tretinoin, adapalene): Help prevent clogged pores.
        *   Benzoyl peroxide: Kills bacteria and helps unclog pores.
        *   Topical antibiotics (e.g., clindamycin, erythromycin): Reduce bacteria and inflammation (often used with benzoyl peroxide to reduce resistance).
        *   Azelaic acid, salicylic acid.
    *   **Oral Medications (for moderate to severe acne):**
        *   Oral antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, sarecycline): Reduce bacteria and inflammation. Often used in combination with topical treatments.
        *   Hormonal therapies (e.g., oral contraceptives, spironolactone) for women.
        *   Oral isotretinoin (for severe, nodulocystic acne): A powerful retinoid that significantly reduces sebum production, prevents clogging, and reduces inflammation and bacteria. Requires careful monitoring due to potential side effects.

---

**19. Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** An allergic response to airborne allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold spores). Symptoms include sneezing (often in fits), runny nose (rhinorrhea), nasal congestion or stuffiness, itchy nose, palate, throat, and eyes. Eyes may be red, watery, and itchy with swelling around them ("allergic shiners" - dark circles under the eyes). Other symptoms can include coughing, sore throat, fatigue, and headaches. Symptoms can be seasonal (related to pollen) or perennial (year-round, related to indoor allergens).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common, affecting a significant portion of the population globally. Often begins in childhood or young adulthood (onset typically between 20 and 40 years old), but can occur at any age. Risk factors include a family history of allergies (atopy), asthma, and atopic dermatitis.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment involves allergen avoidance and medications.
    *   **Allergen Avoidance:** Reducing exposure to known allergens.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Antihistamines: Oral antihistamines (e.g., cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine - non-drowsy; diphenhydramine - drowsy) or nasal antihistamine sprays. Help with sneezing, itching, and runny nose.
        *   Intranasal corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide): The most effective medications for controlling nasal congestion and other symptoms; often considered first-line for persistent symptoms.
        *   Decongestants: Oral or nasal sprays (use nasal sprays short-term). Help with nasal stuffiness.
        *   Leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g., montelukast): Can help with nasal symptoms and may be used in combination with other medications, particularly if asthma is also present.
        *   Immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual tablets): Long-term treatment to desensitize the individual to specific allergens.

**20. Gastroenteritis**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Inflammation of the stomach and intestines, commonly caused by viral infections ("stomach flu"). Symptoms typically include watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and cramps, and sometimes fever, headache, and muscle aches. Dehydration is a significant concern, especially in young children and older adults. Symptoms usually have a rapid onset and last less than two weeks (viral gastroenteritis often lasts 1-2 days, sometimes up to 10).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Extremely common worldwide, affecting people of all ages. More severe morbidity and mortality are seen in the very young (under 5) and the very old (over 65). Viruses (like norovirus and rotavirus) are the most common cause. Bacteria and parasites can also cause gastroenteritis. Spreads easily through contaminated food or water and person-to-person contact.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment is primarily supportive and focused on preventing or treating dehydration. Antibiotics are generally *not* needed for viral gastroenteritis.
    *   **Rehydration:** Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are the mainstay of treatment for mild to moderate dehydration in both children and adults. Intravenous fluids may be needed for severe dehydration or inability to tolerate oral intake. Clear fluids are recommended. Avoiding sugary drinks may be advised in young children.
    *   **Antiemetics:** Medications to help with vomiting (e.g., ondansetron) may be used in some cases to help patients tolerate ORS.
    *   **Antidiarrheal Medications:** Generally not recommended for acute gastroenteritis, especially in children or if there is bloody diarrhea or fever, as they can prolong the illness or mask bacterial infections.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Reserved for specific bacterial or parasitic causes of gastroenteritis identified through stool tests.

---

**21. Obesity**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Defined as having excessive body fat, which is usually assessed using Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m²). A BMI of 30 or higher is typically considered obese. While not a single "illness" in the traditional sense, it is a chronic disease and a major risk factor for numerous other common health problems. Symptoms associated with obesity itself can include fatigue, shortness of breath, increased sweating, snoring and sleep apnea, joint pain (particularly in weight-bearing joints like knees and hips), skin problems (e.g., infections in skin folds), and psychosocial issues.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Highly prevalent globally and affects individuals of all ages, genders, races, and ethnicities. The prevalence has increased significantly in recent decades. Socioeconomic factors, environment, genetics, behavior (diet and physical activity), and certain medical conditions or medications can contribute to obesity.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment primarily involves lifestyle interventions (dietary changes, increased physical activity, behavioral therapy). Medications and surgery are options for individuals who do not achieve sufficient weight loss with lifestyle changes alone, especially if they have obesity-related comorbidities.
    *   **Weight Loss Medications:** Used as an adjunct to lifestyle modifications for individuals with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Examples include:
        *   GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide).
        *   Orlistat (inhibits fat absorption).
        *   Phentermine/Topiramate combination.
        *   Naltrexone/Bupropion combination.
    *   Medications for comorbidities (e.g., antihypertensives, antidiabetics, statins) are often necessary to manage conditions linked to obesity.

**22. Back and Neck Pain**

*   **Common Symptoms:** While low back pain was covered previously (Item #4), pain in the neck (cervical spine) is also very common. Symptoms can include localized pain in the neck, stiffness, limited range of motion, headache (often starting in the back of the head), and pain that radiates into the shoulders, arms, or hands (radiculopathy), potentially with numbness, tingling, or weakness if nerves are compressed. Neck pain can be acute (sudden onset, short duration) or chronic (persisting for weeks or months). Back pain can also affect the thoracic (upper/mid) spine, though less commonly than the lumbar spine. Thoracic pain is often felt between the shoulder blades or in the rib cage area.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Extremely common causes of disability and healthcare visits across adult age groups. Lifetime prevalence is very high. Can affect any age, but typically increases with age. Risk factors include poor posture, sedentary lifestyle, repetitive strain, lifting heavy objects, traumatic injury (e.g., whiplash), underlying conditions (e.g., osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis), and stress.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the cause and severity and often involves a combination of approaches.
    *   **Analgesics:** OTC (paracetamol, NSAIDs) or prescription NSAIDs.
    *   **Muscle Relaxants:** (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine) for short-term relief of muscle spasms, especially in acute neck or back pain.
    *   **Topical Pain Relievers:** NSAID creams or patches.
    *   **Neuropathic Pain Medications:** If nerve compression symptoms (radiculopathy) are significant (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine).
    *   **Physical Therapy:** Exercise and modalities are often key components of treatment.
    *   Injections (e.g., corticosteroid injections) may be used for pain management in specific cases.
    *   Surgery is reserved for select cases with severe, refractory pain, neurological deficits, or structural instability.

---

**23. Viral Warts (Verruca Vulgaris)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Small, rough growths on the skin caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Warts vary in appearance depending on their location.
    *   **Common Warts:** Usually appear on fingers, hands, elbows, knees, and feet. They are raised, rough, and often have tiny black dots within them ("seeds" - actually clotted blood vessels).
    *   **Plantar Warts:** Occur on the soles of the feet. They are often flat or grow inward due to pressure and can be painful when walking. They may have black dots visible after the top layer of skin is removed.
    *   **Flat Warts:** Smaller, smoother, and flatter than other types, often appearing in clusters. Common on the face, arms, and legs.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common, particularly in children, adolescents, and young adults. They are contagious and spread through direct contact with the wart or something that has touched the wart (e.g., shared towels, floors). Risk factors include having cuts or abrasions on the skin and having a weakened immune system. Plantar warts are common in people who walk barefoot in public areas like swimming pools or locker rooms.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to destroy the wart tissue or stimulate an immune response against the virus.
    *   **Topical Treatments:**
        *   Salicylic acid: Available OTC in various forms (liquids, gels, patches). Works by peeling away layers of the wart.
        *   Podofilox or Imiquimod: Used for some types of warts, including genital warts (which are a different category and often managed differently than common warts).
        *   Prescription-strength salicylic acid or combination products.
    *   **Cryotherapy:** Freezing the wart with liquid nitrogen. This can be done in the primary care office. Multiple treatments are often needed.
    *   **Other Procedures:** Electrocautery, surgical excision, laser therapy (less common in primary care).
    *   Duct tape occlusion therapy is a non-pharmacological method sometimes used, although evidence of its effectiveness is mixed.

---

**24. Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelids. Symptoms include redness or pinkness of the white of the eye, itching, gritty feeling in the eye, burning sensation, watery or thick discharge (mucopurulent), crusting of the eyelids (especially in the morning), and sometimes swelling of the eyelids. Vision is usually normal. Causes include viral infections (most common), bacterial infections, allergies (allergic conjunctivitis), and irritants.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common, particularly in young children, where it can spread easily in schools or daycare settings. Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious. Bacterial conjunctivitis is also contagious. Allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious and is more common in people with other allergies. Affects all ages, genders, and races.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the cause.
    *   **Viral Conjunctivitis:** No specific cure; treatment is supportive. Artificial tears can help with irritation. Cold compresses can soothe the eyes. Good hygiene is essential to prevent spread. Symptoms usually resolve within 7-14 days.
    *   **Bacterial Conjunctivitis:** Often treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointment (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim-polymyxin B, fluoroquinolones). Symptoms often improve within a few days of starting treatment. Good hygiene is important.
    *   **Allergic Conjunctivitis:** Treatment involves avoiding the allergen, artificial tears, cold compresses, antihistamine eye drops (OTC or prescription), mast cell stabilizer eye drops, or topical NSAID eye drops. Oral antihistamines may also help.

---

**25. Strep Throat (Streptococcal Pharyngitis)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A bacterial infection of the throat caused by Group A Streptococcus bacteria. While pharyngitis was mentioned (Item #12), Strep throat is a specific and common *bacterial* cause. Classic symptoms include a sudden onset of sore throat, pain with swallowing, fever, red and swollen tonsils (sometimes with white patches or streaks of pus), tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth (petechiae), and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Unlike viral pharyngitis, cough, runny nose, hoarseness, and conjunctivitis are typically absent. Some people may also have a rash (scarlet fever).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Most common in children aged 5-15 years. Less common in children under 3 and in adults. It is contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets. More prevalent during the school year, especially in late winter and early spring.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Antibiotics are necessary to treat Strep throat, primarily to prevent complications like acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, as well as to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms and decrease transmission.
    *   **First-line antibiotics:** Penicillin or Amoxicillin, usually for a 10-day course.
    *   For patients allergic to penicillin: Macrolides (e.g., azithromycin, clarithromycin) or clindamycin may be used.
    *   Pain relievers (paracetamol, ibuprofen) are used for symptomatic relief of sore throat and fever.
    *   Diagnosis is confirmed by a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) or a throat culture.

---

**26. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A group of progressive lung diseases (including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) that make it difficult to breathe. Symptoms often develop slowly and worsen over time. Common symptoms include chronic cough (often producing mucus), shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially during physical activity, wheezing, and chest tightness. Patients with COPD are prone to exacerbations (flare-ups) where symptoms suddenly worsen. Advanced COPD can lead to swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs, and unintended weight loss.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Primarily affects middle-aged and older adults, typically over age 40. The most common cause is long-term exposure to lung irritants, most often cigarette smoke (active or passive). Exposure to air pollution, occupational dusts and chemicals, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a genetic condition) are other risk factors. More common in men traditionally, but now affecting women almost equally due to changes in smoking patterns.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to relieve symptoms, prevent exacerbations, and improve quality of life. COPD is not curable, but treatment can manage it.
    *   **Smoking Cessation:** The most important intervention.
    *   **Bronchodilators:** Inhalers that relax the airways. Short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) for quick relief of breathlessness. Long-acting bronchodilators (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol - LABAs; tiotropium - LAMA) for daily symptom control. Combinations of LABA and LAMA are often used.
    *   **Inhaled Corticosteroids:** May be added to long-acting bronchodilators for patients with more severe symptoms and frequent exacerbations, or those with an "asthma-COPD overlap" phenotype.
    *   **Oral Corticosteroids:** Used for short courses to treat acute exacerbations.
    *   **Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (e.g., roflumilast):** May be used in severe COPD with chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Used to treat bacterial exacerbations.
    *   **Oxygen Therapy:** For patients with low blood oxygen levels.
    *   Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are also a key component of management.

---

**27. Asthma**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. Symptoms vary in severity and frequency and can be triggered by various factors (allergens, respiratory infections, exercise, cold air, stress, irritants like smoke or pollution). Between attacks, symptoms may be mild or absent. Symptoms often improve spontaneously or with treatment.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Can begin at any age, but often starts in childhood. Affects millions of people worldwide. More common in boys than girls in childhood, but more common in women than men in adulthood. Risk factors include a family history of asthma or allergies, a history of viral respiratory infections in childhood, exposure to allergens or irritants, and certain environmental factors. More prevalent and severe in certain racial/ethnic groups and low-income populations.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to control inflammation, prevent symptoms, and manage acute exacerbations. It involves a combination of quick-relief and long-term control medications.
    *   **Quick-Relief Medications (for acute symptoms):**
        *   Short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) (e.g., albuterol). These are rescue inhalers used as needed for symptom relief.
    *   **Long-Term Control Medications (taken regularly to prevent symptoms):**
        *   Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone). These are the most effective long-term control medications to reduce inflammation. Often the first-line daily treatment for persistent asthma.
        *   Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol). Used in combination with ICS for moderate to severe asthma control. LABAs should generally not be used alone in asthma.
        *   Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast). Oral medications that help with symptom control and can be used alone or with ICS.
        *   Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) (e.g., tiotropium). Can be added for severe asthma.
        *   Biologics (e.g., omalizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab): Used for severe, persistent allergic or eosinophilic asthma.
    *   Oral corticosteroids may be used for short courses to treat severe asthma exacerbations.

---

**28. Migraine**

*   **Common Symptoms:** As discussed under Headaches (Item #16), migraines are a specific type of primary headache characterized by moderate to severe, often throbbing or pulsating pain, usually unilateral (on one side of the head), and commonly associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia). Physical activity often worsens the pain. Migraine episodes typically last from 4 to 72 hours. Some people experience an aura before the headache begins, which can involve visual disturbances (e.g., flashing lights, blind spots), sensory changes (e.g., tingling), or speech difficulties.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Affects a significant portion of the population. More common in women than men, particularly during their reproductive years. Often begins in adolescence or early adulthood. Genetics play a strong role; migraines often run in families. Various triggers can precipitate a migraine attack (stress, hormonal changes, certain foods/drinks, lack of sleep, weather changes).
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment involves acute treatment for attacks and preventive treatment for frequent or severe migraines.
    *   **Acute Treatment:**
        *   OTC analgesics (NSAIDs, paracetamol) for mild to moderate attacks.
        *   Triptans (e.g., sumatriptan, rizatriptan, zolmitriptan): Prescription medications effective for moderate to severe migraines.
        *   Ditans (e.g., lasmiditan) and CGRP receptor antagonists (e.g., ubrogepant, rimegepant) are newer oral medications for acute treatment.
        *   Ergot alkaloids (e.g., ergotamine).
        *   Antiemetics (e.g., prochlorperazine, ondansetron) for nausea and vomiting.
    *   **Preventive Treatment:** Considered for individuals with frequent or disabling migraines (e.g., ≥ 4 migraine days per month).
        *   Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, metoprolol).
        *   Antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, venlafaxine).
        *   Anti-seizure medications (e.g., topiramate, valproate).
        *   CGRP inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies administered by injection or infusion, or oral forms): Newer preventive medications.
        *   Botulinum toxin A injections for chronic migraine (≥ 15 headache days per month, with at least 8 meeting migraine criteria).

---

**29. Iron Deficiency Anemia**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency globally and a common cause of anemia. Anemia means a reduced number of red blood cells or amount of hemoglobin. Symptoms are often non-specific and depend on the severity. They can include fatigue, weakness, pallor (pale skin), shortness of breath, dizziness, cold hands and feet, headache, brittle nails, hair loss, and a sore tongue. Some people crave non-food items like ice, dirt, or clay (pica). Severe deficiency can lead to restless legs syndrome or difficulty swallowing.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Can affect people of all ages, but is most common in young children, adolescent girls, pregnant women, and women of childbearing age due to menstrual blood loss. Vegetarians and vegans, people with certain gastrointestinal conditions (e.g., celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease) or who have undergone gastric surgery, and those with chronic bleeding (e.g., from ulcers, polyps, or cancers) are also at higher risk.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment involves identifying and treating the underlying cause of iron deficiency and supplementing iron.
    *   **Iron Supplementation:** Oral iron supplements are the standard treatment (e.g., ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate). Dosage and duration of treatment (often several months) depend on the severity of the deficiency. Taking iron with vitamin C can improve absorption.
    *   **Dietary Changes:** Increasing intake of iron-rich foods (red meat, poultry, fish, beans, spinach, fortified cereals).
    *   **Treating the Cause:** Addressing the source of blood loss (e.g., treating ulcers, managing heavy menstrual bleeding) or malabsorption.
    *   **Intravenous Iron:** May be needed for severe deficiency, inability to tolerate oral iron, or certain malabsorption conditions.
    *   Blood transfusion in severe, symptomatic anemia.

---

**30. Thyroid Disorders (Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** The thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate metabolism. Dysfunction can lead to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid, too little hormone) or hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid, too much hormone).
    *   **Hypothyroidism:** Symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, feeling cold, constipation, dry skin, thinning hair, brittle nails, muscle aches and weakness, joint pain or stiffness, depression, impaired memory, slow heart rate, and heavy or irregular menstrual periods.
    *   **Hyperthyroidism:** Symptoms include weight loss despite increased appetite, rapid or irregular heart rate (palpitations), nervousness, anxiety, irritability, tremor (usually fine trembling in the hands and fingers), sweating, heat intolerance, changes in menstrual patterns, difficulty sleeping, muscle weakness, and sometimes bulging eyes (Graves' ophthalmopathy, specifically with Graves' disease).
*   **Affected Demographic:** More common in women than men. Can occur at any age, but prevalence increases with age. Autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis causing hypothyroidism, Graves' disease causing hyperthyroidism) is the most common cause. Family history of thyroid disease increases the risk.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the specific disorder.
    *   **Hypothyroidism:** Treated with synthetic thyroid hormone replacement, typically levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl). Dosage is adjusted based on blood tests (TSH levels). This is usually lifelong treatment.
    *   **Hyperthyroidism:** Treatment aims to reduce thyroid hormone production or effect. Options include:
        *   Antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole, propylthiouracil). These medications reduce hormone synthesis.
        *   Radioactive iodine therapy: Destroys thyroid cells that produce hormones.
        *   Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) to manage symptoms like rapid heart rate and tremor.
        *   Surgery (thyroidectomy): Removal of the thyroid gland.

**31. Acute Gastroenteritis**

*   **Common Symptoms:** As mentioned in Item #20, this involves inflammation of the stomach and intestines, leading to symptoms like watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and sometimes fever. Viral causes are most common (e.g., Norovirus, Rotavirus), but bacterial (e.g., E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter) and parasitic (e.g., Giardia) infections can also occur.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Extremely common across all age groups. Young children and older adults are at higher risk for severe dehydration. Spread is often through contaminated food or water, or person-to-person contact, making outbreaks common in close communities like schools or cruise ships.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment is primarily supportive.
    *   **Rehydration:** Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS) are crucial to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Severe dehydration may require intravenous fluids.
    *   **Antiemetics:** May be used to control vomiting in some cases (e.g., ondansetron) to help with ORS intake.
    *   **Antidiarrheal Medications:** Generally avoided in acute infectious gastroenteritis, especially in children or if fever/bloody stool is present, due to risk of prolonging infection or complications. May be considered cautiously in adults with non-severe watery diarrhea.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Only used for specific bacterial or parasitic infections identified or strongly suspected, based on stool testing or clinical context (e.g., travelers' diarrhea, severe dysentery). Common antibiotics depend on the pathogen (e.g., azithromycin, ciprofloxacin).

---

**32. Otitis Externa (Swimmer's Ear)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** An infection of the outer ear canal, often caused by water trapped in the ear or injury to the ear canal skin. Symptoms include ear pain (often worsening with movement of the outer ear), itching in the ear canal, discharge from the ear (clear, cloudy, or pus-like), redness and swelling of the ear canal, decreased hearing (if the canal is swollen shut), and sometimes fever.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Common in people who swim frequently, hence the name "swimmer's ear." Can affect people of all ages but is more common in children and young adults. Risk factors include swimming, trauma to the ear canal (e.g., from cotton swabs, scratching), certain skin conditions (eczema), and use of earplugs or hearing aids.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment usually involves topical ear drops.

    *   **Medications:**
        *   Antispasmodics (e.g., dicyclomine, hyoscyamine): Help reduce abdominal pain and cramping.
        *   Laxatives: Used for IBS-C (e.g., PEG, lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide).
        *   Antidiarrheals (e.g., loperamide): Used for diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D).
        *   Antibiotics (e.g., rifaximin): May be used for IBS-D, particularly if bacterial overgrowth is suspected.
        *   Antidepressants: Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help with pain and symptoms, even in people without depression.
        *   Specific medications for IBS-D (e.g., alosetron - restricted use) and IBS-C.
    *   Psychological therapies (e.g., CBT, hypnotherapy) can also be effective.

---

**51. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or days. This causes a buildup of waste products in the blood and makes it hard for the kidneys to filter fluid properly. Symptoms can include decreased urine output (oliguria), swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet (edema), shortness of breath, fatigue, confusion, nausea, weakness, and irregular heartbeat. AKI may also be asymptomatic and detected through blood tests (elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen - BUN).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Can occur at any age but is more common in hospitalized patients, older adults, and individuals with underlying health conditions such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart failure, liver disease, or hypertension. Causes are broadly categorized as pre-renal (reduced blood flow to the kidneys, e.g., dehydration, blood loss), intrinsic (direct damage to the kidneys, e.g., toxins, certain medications, infections), or post-renal (blockage of urine flow, e.g., kidney stones, enlarged prostate, tumors).
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Management focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause, preventing further kidney damage, and managing complications.
    *   **Treating the Underlying Cause:** This is the most critical step (e.g., fluid resuscitation for dehydration, stopping nephrotoxic medications, relieving urinary tract obstruction).
    *   **Fluid Management:** Careful management of fluid intake and output. Diuretics may be used in some cases to help remove excess fluid.
    *   **Medications to Manage Complications:** Treating electrolyte imbalances (e.g., calcium, potassium), managing acidosis.
    *   Avoiding medications that are hard on the kidneys or require kidney excretion.
    *   Kidney replacement therapy (dialysis) may be needed in severe cases.

---

**52. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they should. It often progresses slowly over years and may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Symptoms, when they occur, are often non-specific and appear in later stages (renal failure). They can include fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps, dry and itchy skin, swelling in the feet and ankles, increased or decreased urination, and difficulty concentrating. CKD is diagnosed based on persistent abnormalities in kidney structure or function (e.g., reduced glomerular filtration rate - GFR, protein in the urine).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Common, particularly in older adults. Major risk factors include diabetes mellitus (the leading cause), hypertension (the second leading cause), cardiovascular disease, family history of kidney disease, obesity, smoking, and certain ethnic groups (e.g., African Americans, Hispanic Americans).
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to slow the progression of kidney damage, manage complications, and treat underlying causes.
    *   **Managing Underlying Causes:** Strict control of blood pressure (often with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which also protect the kidneys) and blood sugar (in diabetes).
    *   **Medications to Manage Complications:**
        *   Diuretics for fluid retention and swelling.
        *   Medications to lower potassium levels (e.g., potassium binders).
        *   Medications to manage anemia (erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, iron supplements).
        *   Medications to control phosphorus and calcium levels and manage bone disease (e.g., phosphate binders, vitamin D supplements).
    *   Dietary modifications (e.g., restriction of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and protein) are often important.
    *   In advanced CKD (ESRD - End-Stage Renal Disease), kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant) is necessary.

**53. Heart Failure (HF)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A chronic condition where the heart muscle can't pump blood as well as it should. Symptoms vary depending on the type and severity of HF (e.g., HF with reduced ejection fraction - HFrEF, HF with preserved ejection fraction - HFpEF). Common symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially during activity or when lying flat (orthopnea), fatigue, weakness, swelling (edema) in the legs, ankles, and feet, rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations), persistent cough or wheezing with white or pink blood-tinged mucus, abdominal swelling, loss of appetite, and difficulty concentrating.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Common, particularly in older adults. Major causes include coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, previous heart attack, valvular heart disease, certain infections, and some medications. More prevalent in certain racial/ethnic groups (e.g., African Americans) and men, although women tend to develop it later in life and have a higher prevalence of HFpEF.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to improve symptoms, slow progression, and reduce hospitalizations and mortality. It involves a combination of medications.
    *   **Medications for HFrEF (Guideline-directed medical therapy - GDMT):**
        *   ACE inhibitors or ARBs or ARNI (Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor, e.g., sacubitril/valsartan).
        *   Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, bisoprolol).
        *   Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone).
        *   SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., dapagliflozin, empagliflozin). These are now recommended for both HFrEF and HFpEF.
    *   **Medications for Symptom Relief:**
        *   Diuretics (e.g., furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide) to reduce fluid retention and swelling.
        *   Digoxin (less commonly used, may help with symptoms and reduce hospitalizations in some cases).
    *   Management of underlying causes and risk factors is also crucial.

*   **Common Symptoms:** The most common type of heart disease, caused by plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (coronary arteries). This reduces blood flow. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort (angina), often described as pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain in the center of the chest. Angina is typically triggered by physical or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Other symptoms can include shortness of breath, palpitations, weakness, dizziness, nausea, or sweating. Sometimes the first symptom is a heart attack (myocardial infarction), which involves more severe, prolonged chest pain, often radiating to the arm, jaw, or back, along with shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, and dizziness.
*   **Affected Demographic:** A leading cause of death worldwide. Risk increases with age. More common in men than women at younger ages, but risk in women increases after menopause, and CAD is a major cause of death in women. Risk factors include hypertension, high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia), diabetes, smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history of heart disease, and age.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to relieve symptoms, slow disease progression, prevent blood clots, and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Diet (low in saturated/trans fats), exercise, smoking cessation, weight management, stress reduction.
    *   **Medications to Relieve Symptoms (Angina):**
        *   Nitroglycerin (sublingual or spray) for immediate relief.
        *   Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or long-acting nitrates for preventing angina.
    *   **Medications to Reduce Risk (Secondary Prevention):**
        *   Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) to prevent blood clots.
        *   Statins to lower cholesterol.
        *   ACE inhibitors or ARBs to lower blood pressure and protect the heart.
        *   Beta-blockers.
    *   Procedures like angioplasty with stenting or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be necessary for significant blockages.

**55. Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident - CVA)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted, either by a blockage (ischemic stroke, most common) or bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke). Symptoms are sudden and depend on the area of the brain affected. A common way to remember symptoms is the acronym **FAST**:
    *   **F - Face drooping:** Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop?
    *   **A - Arm weakness:** Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?
    *   **S - Speech difficulty:** Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Is their speech slurred or strange?
    *   **T - Time to call 911:** If you see any of these signs, call for emergency medical help immediately.
    Other symptoms can include sudden numbness or weakness, confusion, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, and a sudden, severe headache with no known cause. A Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), or "mini-stroke," has similar symptoms but lasts only a few minutes and does not cause permanent damage, though it is a warning sign for future stroke risk.
*   **Affected Demographic:** While risk increases significantly with age, strokes can occur at any age. Risk factors are similar to CAD: hypertension (the most important risk factor), diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, heart disease (especially atrial fibrillation), family history of stroke, and previous TIA or stroke. Stroke is more common in men than women, but women have strokes at older ages and are more likely to die from them. Higher incidence and mortality in African Americans.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the type of stroke and aims to restore blood flow (ischemic) or control bleeding (hemorrhagic), prevent complications, and prevent future strokes.
    *   **Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment:**
        *   Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a clot-busting drug, if administered within a few hours of symptom onset in eligible patients.
        *   Mechanical thrombectomy (clot removal procedure) in select cases.
    *   **Secondary Prevention Medications (to prevent future strokes):**
        *   Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) or anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, DOACs like apixaban, rivaroxaban) for ischemic stroke, depending on the cause (e.g., atrial fibrillation).
        *   Antihypertensive medications (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics) to control blood pressure.
        *   Statins to lower cholesterol.
        *   Medications to manage diabetes.
    *   Rehabilitation (physical, occupational, speech therapy) is crucial after a stroke.
    *   Management of hemorrhagic stroke may involve controlling blood pressure, reversing anticoagulation if needed, and sometimes surgery.

**56. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** An irregular and often rapid heart rate that can cause poor blood flow to the body. Symptoms can include palpitations (a feeling of rapid, fluttering, or pounding heartbeat), shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain or pressure. However, many people with AFib have no symptoms (asymptomatic). AFib is a major risk factor for stroke because blood can pool and clot in the atria, and these clots can travel to the brain.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Prevalence increases with age, particularly after age 65. More common in men than women. Risk factors include hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, excessive alcohol consumption, and family history.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to control the heart rate, restore normal rhythm (if appropriate), and prevent stroke.
    *   **Rate Control:** Medications to slow the heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin).
    *   **Rhythm Control:** Medications (antiarrhythmics, e.g., amiodarone, flecainide, sotalol) or procedures (cardioversion, catheter ablation) to restore and maintain a normal heart rhythm.
    *   **Stroke Prevention (Anticoagulation):** This is a critical part of treatment for most people with AFib, especially those with other risk factors. Medications include:
        *   Warfarin.
        *   Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) (e.g., apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) are often preferred over warfarin due to ease of use and lower bleeding risk in many patients.
    *   The decision for anticoagulation is based on stroke risk assessment (e.g., CHA₂DS₂-VASc score).

---

**57. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A circulatory condition in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs, usually the legs. The most common symptom is leg pain when walking or exercising (claudication), which typically eases with rest. Pain can occur in the calves, thighs, or buttocks. Other symptoms can include numbness or weakness in the legs, coldness in the lower leg or foot, sores on the toes, feet, or legs that won't heal, a change in the color of the legs, hair loss or slower hair growth on the legs, slower growth of the toenails, and absent or weak pulses in the legs or feet. Severe PAD can cause pain at rest and critical limb ischemia, potentially leading to amputation.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Common, particularly in older adults. Risk factors are similar to CAD and stroke: smoking (the strongest risk factor), diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and age. More common in men than women.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to reduce symptoms, improve walking distance, and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Smoking cessation (essential), regular exercise program (supervised exercise therapy is very effective for claudication), weight management, and healthy diet.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
        *   Statins to lower cholesterol.
        *   Medications to control blood pressure and diabetes.
        *   Medications to improve walking distance (e.g., cilostazol - not for patients with heart failure; pentoxifylline - less effective).
    *   Procedures like angioplasty or surgery (bypass) may be needed for significant blockages causing severe symptoms or critical limb ischemia.

---

**58. Chronic Pain**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Pain that is persistent or recurrent and lasts longer than 3-6 months, or beyond the expected time for healing. It can affect any part of the body (e.g., chronic back pain, chronic headache, fibromyalgia, chronic widespread pain). Symptoms include ongoing pain (which can vary in intensity, location, and quality), fatigue, sleep disturbances, reduced activity levels, depressed mood, anxiety, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Chronic pain significantly impacts quality of life, physical function, and mental well-being.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common, affecting millions of people, and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Can occur at any age but is more prevalent in older adults. More common in women than men. Can result from injury, illness, or nerve damage, but often the cause is not fully clear or persists long after the initial injury has healed. Psychological and social factors also play a significant role.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Management is often complex and multidisciplinary, involving physical therapy, psychological support, and medications. The goal is often pain management and improving function and quality of life, rather than complete pain eradication.
    *   **Analgesics:** OTC and prescription NSAIDs. Paracetamol (acetaminophen).
    *   **Neuropathic Pain Agents:** Certain antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, TCAs) and anti-seizure medications (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin) are often effective for neuropathic pain.
    *   **Opioids:** Should be used cautiously and typically as a last resort for chronic non-cancer pain due to risks of addiction, tolerance, and side effects. If used, careful patient selection, risk assessment, and monitoring are essential.
    *   Muscle relaxants (short-term use).
    *   Topical pain relievers.
    *   Multimodal treatment approaches, including physical therapy, exercise, behavioral therapy (e.g., CBT), and interventional procedures (e.g., injections), are often more effective than medication alone.

**59. Gout**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A type of inflammatory arthritis caused by a buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. The hallmark symptom is a sudden, severe attack of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in a joint, most commonly the joint at the base of the big toe (podagra). Attacks often occur suddenly, frequently at night. Other joints can be affected, including the ankle, knee, elbow, wrist, and fingers. Skin over the affected joint may be warm, red, and shiny. Between attacks, the joint may be asymptomatic. Recurrent attacks can lead to joint damage and formation of tophi (urate crystal deposits) under the skin.
*   **Affected Demographic:** More common in men than women, especially between the ages of 30 and 50. Risk in women increases after menopause. Risk factors include high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia), which can be caused by genetics, diet (high intake of purine-rich foods like red meat, organ meats, shellfish; high intake of sugary drinks, especially with high-fructose corn syrup; excessive alcohol consumption), obesity, certain medical conditions (e.g., kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome), and certain medications (e.g., thiazide diuretics, aspirin, some chemotherapy drugs).
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment involves managing acute attacks and preventing future attacks by lowering uric acid levels.
    *   **Acute Attack Treatment:**
        *   NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin).
        *   Colchicine (most effective when started early).
        *   Corticosteroids (oral or injected into the joint).
    *   **Preventive Treatment (Urate-Lowering Therapy - ULT):** Started after an acute attack resolves, for individuals with recurrent attacks, tophi, or joint damage. Goal is to lower uric acid levels to prevent crystal formation.
        *   Allopurinol: The most common ULT; reduces uric acid production.
        *   Febuxostat: Another xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces uric acid production.
        *   Uricosurics (e.g., probenecid): Increase uric acid excretion in the urine (less commonly used).
    *   Lifestyle modifications (weight loss, dietary changes, limiting alcohol) are also important for prevention.

**60. Osteoporosis**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A disease characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and increased risk of fractures. Often called a "silent disease" because there are typically no symptoms in the early stages. The first sign is often a fracture, commonly of the hip, spine (vertebral compression fracture), or wrist, resulting from a minor fall or sometimes just from normal activities. Symptoms of vertebral fractures may include sudden, severe back pain, loss of height, or stooped posture.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Much more common in women than men, particularly after menopause due to the rapid decline in estrogen levels. Risk increases with age. Other risk factors include family history of osteoporosis or fracture, being thin or having a small frame, certain medical conditions (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease), certain medications (e.g., long-term corticosteroids, some anti-seizure medications, certain cancer treatments), smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle, and low calcium or vitamin D intake.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment aims to prevent fractures and increase bone density. Often involves lifestyle modifications and medications.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake (through diet or supplements), regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercise, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol intake, and fall prevention strategies.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid): Slow bone breakdown; often first-line treatment.
        *   Denosumab: Another antiresorptive agent, administered by injection.
        *   Romosozumab, Teriparatide, Abaloparatide: Anabolic agents that stimulate bone formation (used for severe osteoporosis).
        *   Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) (e.g., raloxifene): Have estrogen-like effects on bone (also used for breast cancer prevention).
        *   Calcitonin (less commonly used, primarily for pain from vertebral fractures).
    *   Choice of medication depends on the severity of osteoporosis, fracture risk, patient factors, and potential side effects.

**61. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, which is common in older men. As the prostate enlarges, it can press on the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body), causing urinary symptoms. Symptoms often referred to as LUTS (Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms) include: frequent urination (especially at night - nocturia), urgent need to urinate, difficulty starting urination (hesitancy), weak or interrupted urine stream, dribbling after urinating, and a feeling that the bladder is not completely empty. In severe cases, BPH can lead to urinary tract infections, bladder stones, kidney damage, or acute urinary retention (inability to urinate).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common in aging men. The prevalence increases significantly with age; it is rare before age 40 but affects more than half of men in their 60s and up to 90% of men in their 70s and 80s. The exact cause is not fully understood but is related to hormonal changes with aging. Race and genetics may play a role.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms.
    *   **Watchful waiting:** For mild symptoms.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin, terazosin): Relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making it easier to urinate. Often provide rapid symptom relief.
        *   5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride): Shrink the prostate gland over time by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). May take several months to be effective.
        *   Combination therapy (alpha-blocker + 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor).
        *   PDE5 inhibitors (e.g., tadalafil - also used for erectile dysfunction) can help improve LUTS in men with BPH.
    *   Minimally invasive procedures or surgery may be needed for more severe symptoms or complications.

---

**62. Erectile Dysfunction (ED)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** The inability to get and keep an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. Symptoms can include trouble getting an erection, trouble keeping an erection, and reduced sexual desire. ED can be a sign of an underlying health problem.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Common, and prevalence increases with age. However, it is not a normal part of aging and is often treatable. Risk factors are similar to those for cardiovascular disease: diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse, sedentary lifestyle, certain medications (e.g., antihypertensives, antidepressants), psychological factors (stress, anxiety, depression), hormonal imbalances (e.g., low testosterone), and neurological conditions.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment addresses the underlying cause and aims to facilitate erections.
    *   **Treating Underlying Causes:** Managing diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol; lifestyle changes (weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol); adjusting medications if possible.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), avanafil (Stendra)). These oral medications increase blood flow to the penis in response to sexual stimulation.
    *   **Other Options:** Alprostadil (injected into the penis or inserted as a suppository into the urethra), vacuum erection devices, penile implants.
    *   Psychological counseling can be helpful, especially if the cause is psychological.

---

**63. Vaginitis**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Inflammation of the vagina, often caused by infection or changes in the normal balance of vaginal bacteria or yeast. Symptoms vary depending on the cause but commonly include changes in vaginal discharge (color, odor, amount), itching, irritation, pain during intercourse, and painful urination. Common types include bacterial vaginosis (BV), yeast infections (candidiasis), and trichomoniasis (an STI).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common, primarily affecting women of reproductive age. Risk factors for BV include new or multiple sexual partners, douching, and using certain hygiene products. Yeast infections are also common and can be triggered by antibiotic use, hormonal changes, pregnancy, diabetes, or a weakened immune system. Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the cause.
    *   **Bacterial Vaginosis (BV):** Treated with antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole - oral or vaginal gel, clindamycin - oral or vaginal cream).
    *   **Yeast Infections (Candidiasis):** Treated with antifungal medications (e.g., fluconazole - oral pill, clotrimazole, miconazole, tioconazole - vaginal creams, suppositories, or ointments).
    *   **Trichomoniasis:** Treated with antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole or tinidazole - oral pills). Sexual partners also need to be treated to prevent reinfection.

---

**64. Menopause and Perimenopause Symptoms**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Menopause is the time that marks the end of menstrual cycles, typically occurring between ages 45 and 55. Perimenopause is the transition period leading up to menopause. Symptoms are caused by declining hormone levels, particularly estrogen. Common symptoms include: hot flashes (sudden feelings of warmth, often with sweating, flushing, and rapid heartbeat), night sweats, irregular menstrual periods (during perimenopause), vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse, decreased libido, mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression), sleep disturbances (insomnia), fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and joint aches. Long-term effects of estrogen deficiency include increased risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Affects all women as they age. The average age of menopause is 51 in the US. Perimenopause can begin several years before menopause.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment focuses on managing bothersome symptoms and preventing long-term complications.
    *   **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) / Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT):** Estrogen therapy (with progesterone if the woman has a uterus) is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Can be administered orally, transdermally (patch, gel, spray), or vaginally (for vaginal symptoms only). Use of HRT is individualized based on benefits and risks.
    *   **Non-hormonal Medications for Hot Flashes:** Certain antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs), gabapentin, or clonidine.
    *   **Vaginal Moisturizers and Lubricants:** For vaginal dryness.
    *   Management of associated conditions like osteoporosis (see Item #60).

**91. Vertigo**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A sensation of spinning or whirling, either of oneself or of the surroundings, often associated with dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and loss of balance. It is a symptom, not a diagnosis itself, and indicates a problem with the vestibular system (inner ear or brain). Common causes include Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV - sudden, brief episodes triggered by head position changes), Meniere's disease (recurrent episodes with hearing loss, tinnitus, and fullness in the ear), vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis (inflammation of the inner ear or nerve, often after a viral infection, causing severe, persistent vertigo), and sometimes central causes (e.g., stroke, migraine).
*   **Affected Demographic:** Can affect people of all ages but is more common in older adults. The prevalence of BPPV increases with age. Vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis can affect adults of any age. Meniere's disease typically begins between ages 20 and 50. Women are more commonly affected by BPPV and Meniere's disease.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the cause.
    *   **BPPV:** Treated with physical maneuvers (e.g., Epley maneuver) to reposition crystals in the inner ear. Medications are generally not effective for BPPV itself but may be used for associated nausea.
    *   **Vestibular Neuritis/Labyrinthitis:** Antiviral medications are sometimes used if a viral cause is strongly suspected, but primarily treated with rest, fluids, and sometimes short courses of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Medications to suppress the vestibular system and reduce symptoms (e.g., antihistamines like meclizine, benzodiazepines) may be used for acute, severe vertigo, but long-term use is discouraged as it can hinder central compensation.
    *   **Meniere's Disease:** Low-sodium diet and diuretics may help reduce fluid buildup in the inner ear. Medications like meclizine or benzodiazepines may be used for acute attacks. Steroid injections into the ear or surgery may be considered in severe cases.
    *   Vestibular rehabilitation therapy can help improve balance and reduce dizziness.

**92. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) / Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME)**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A complex, chronic illness characterized by overwhelming fatigue that is not improved by rest and is worsened by physical or mental activity (post-exertional malaise). Other core symptoms include sleep problems (feeling unrefreshed after sleep), cognitive difficulties ("brain fog" - problems with memory, concentration), and orthostatic intolerance (symptoms worsen when standing up). May also have muscle pain, joint pain, headache, sore throat, tender lymph nodes, and flu-like symptoms. Diagnosis requires specific criteria to be met and ruling out other medical conditions.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Can affect people of any age, but most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40. More common in women than men. The exact cause is unknown, but it may be triggered by an infection (viral or bacterial), physical or emotional trauma, or other factors. Genetics and immune system dysfunction may play a role.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** There is no specific cure. Treatment is focused on symptom management and improving function, often through a multidisciplinary approach.
    *   **Pain Management:** OTC or prescription analgesics (NSAIDs, paracetamol), low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or gabapentin/pregabalin for pain and sleep.
    *   **Sleep Management:** Medications for insomnia (e.g., sedating antidepressants, sleep aids - used cautiously).
    *   **Orthostatic Intolerance:** Medications to help with blood pressure regulation (e.g., fludrocortisone, midodrine) or beta-blockers.
    *   **Cognitive Symptoms:** May benefit from strategies like pacing and cognitive rehabilitation.
    *   Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) was historically recommended but is now controversial due to the risk of exacerbating post-exertional malaise. Pacing (balancing activity and rest) is often a preferred strategy. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) may help manage the impact of the illness on daily life.

**93. Fibromyalgia**

*   **Common Symptoms:** A chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, often described as a constant dull ache, accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbances (difficulty falling or staying asleep, restless legs syndrome), and cognitive difficulties ("fibro fog" - problems with memory, concentration). People with fibromyalgia may also experience headaches (often tension headaches or migraines), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), anxiety, and depression. Pain often occurs in specific "tender points" on the body, though the diagnostic criteria now rely more on widespread pain and other symptoms.
*   **Affected Demographic:** More common in women than men, typically diagnosed in middle age, but can occur at any age. The cause is unknown but is thought to involve a problem with how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals (central sensitization). Risk factors include family history, certain infections, physical or emotional trauma, and other rheumatic conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus).
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment focuses on reducing pain and improving sleep, fatigue, and quality of life, often with a combination of approaches.
    *   **Non-pharmacological:** Exercise (especially gentle aerobic exercise), stress reduction techniques, sleep hygiene, physical therapy, counseling.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Analgesics: OTC pain relievers (paracetamol, NSAIDs) may provide mild relief. Tramadol. Opioids are generally not recommended for chronic fibromyalgia pain.
        *   Certain Antidepressants: SNRIs (duloxetine, milnacipran) and tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline) can help with pain, sleep, and mood.
        *   Anti-seizure Medications: Pregabalin and gabapentin are approved for fibromyalgia pain.
    *   Management often involves addressing co-occurring conditions like IBS, anxiety, or depression.

**94. Diverticulitis**

*   **Common Symptoms:** Inflammation or infection of small pouches (diverticula) that can form in the wall of the colon. The most common symptom is constant, severe pain, typically in the lower left side of the abdomen (in Western populations - can be on the right in Asian populations). Pain may worsen with movement. Other symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea), abdominal tenderness, and sometimes bloating.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Common, particularly in older adults. Prevalence increases with age; it is rare before age 40. Risk factors include older age, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, a diet low in fiber and high in red meat, and use of certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs, corticosteroids). Diverticulosis (having the pouches without inflammation) is very common, but only a subset of people develop diverticulitis.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment depends on the severity. Uncomplicated diverticulitis (most cases) can often be managed outpatient.
    *   **Uncomplicated Diverticulitis (Outpatient):**
        *   Antibiotics: Often prescribed, although evidence for their necessity in all cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis is debated. Common choices include oral antibiotics covering gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin + metronidazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole + metronidazole).
        *   Pain Control: Paracetamol. NSAIDs should generally be avoided during acute diverticulitis due to potential risks.
        *   Diet: Initially clear liquids, gradually advancing diet as symptoms improve.
    *   **Complicated Diverticulitis (requires hospitalization):** Severe pain, high fever, signs of perforation, abscess, fistula, or obstruction. Treated with intravenous antibiotics, bowel rest, and potentially surgery.

*   **Common Symptoms:** Swollen, inflamed veins in the rectum and anus. Can be internal (inside the rectum) or external (under the skin around the anus).
    *   **Internal Hemorrhoids:** Often painless but may cause bleeding during bowel movements (bright red blood on the stool, toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl). May prolapse (protrude) through the anus, which can be painful and cause itching or irritation.
    *   **External Hemorrhoids:** Located around the anus and can be painful, itchy, and swollen. May thrombose (a blood clot forms within the external hemorrhoid), causing severe pain and a hard lump.
*   **Affected Demographic:** Very common, affecting millions of people. Prevalence increases with age. Risk factors include chronic constipation or diarrhea, straining during bowel movements, sitting for long periods on the toilet, pregnancy, obesity, a low-fiber diet, and heavy lifting.
*   **Commonly Prescribed Drugs/Medications:** Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and reducing swelling.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Increasing fiber intake and fluid intake to soften stools and prevent straining, avoiding prolonged sitting on the toilet, regular exercise.
    *   **Topical Treatments:** Creams, ointments, suppositories containing hydrocortisone (to reduce inflammation and itching), lidocaine (to reduce pain), or witch hazel (astringent). Use of hydrocortisone topicals should be limited to short periods.
    *   **Oral Pain Relievers:** Paracetamol, NSAIDs (used cautiously in some individuals).
    *   **Fiber Supplements:** (e.g., psyllium, methylcellulose) to soften stools.
    *   Procedures (e.g., rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy) or surgery may be needed for larger or symptomatic internal hemorrhoids or thrombosed external hemorrhoids.
