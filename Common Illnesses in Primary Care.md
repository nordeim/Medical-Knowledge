# Common Illnesses in Primary Care

## Overview

Primary care serves as the cornerstone of healthcare systems, managing a vast spectrum of patient needs, from acute illnesses to chronic disease management and preventive care. General practitioners are often the first point of contact for patients, requiring broad knowledge and the ability to differentiate common, self-limiting conditions from those requiring urgent intervention or specialist referral. This document aims to provide a comprehensive reference for common illnesses encountered in primary care, offering details on symptoms, affected demographics, typical medications, differential diagnoses, red-flag symptoms, ICD-10 codes, and relevant laboratory investigations. While this list is extensive, the practice of medicine is ever-evolving, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and the integration of new evidence and guidelines into clinical practice.

Based on available data, common reasons for primary care visits include upper respiratory tract infections, hypertension, routine health maintenance, arthritis, diabetes, depression or anxiety, pneumonia, acute otitis media, back pain, and dermatitis. Patient-reported reasons for visits often include symptomatic complaints such as cough, back pain, abdominal symptoms, pharyngitis, fever, headache, and fatigue. Chronic conditions account for a significant proportion of visits, particularly in older adults.

## Common Illnesses

Here is a detailed breakdown of common illnesses encountered in primary care, following the established structure:

---

### **1. Hypertension (Essential)**

-   **Symptoms**: Often asymptomatic, earning it the moniker "silent killer." When symptoms occur, they can include headaches (commonly in the back of the head upon waking), dizziness, visual changes (blurred or double vision), facial flushing, nosebleeds, and shortness of breath, especially with exertion. Severe hypertension may present with symptoms of a hypertensive crisis, such as a very severe headache, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or neurological deficits.
-   **Demographics**: Prevalence increases with age, particularly after 45. Males are more commonly affected than females before menopause, with rates becoming similar or higher in postmenopausal women. There is a higher prevalence and often greater severity in Black populations. Other risk factors include obesity, family history, high sodium intake, sedentary lifestyle, and excessive alcohol consumption.
-   **Medications**:
    *   **First-line (used alone or in combination):** Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone), ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril), Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) (e.g., losartan, valsartan), Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) (e.g., amlodipine, nifedipine).
    *   **Other commonly used:** Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, carvedilol - often for specific indications like post-myocardial infarction or heart failure), Alpha-blockers (e.g., prazosin, terazosin - can be useful with concomitant benign prostatic hyperplasia), Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone - for resistant hypertension or primary hyperaldosteronism). Medication choice is often guided by comorbidities, age, and race. Single-pill combination therapies are often recommended to improve adherence.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: It's crucial to consider secondary causes of hypertension, especially in younger patients, those with sudden onset or severe hypertension, or those whose blood pressure is difficult to control despite multiple medications. These include: Pheochromocytoma, Renal artery stenosis, Primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, Thyroid disorders (hypo- or hyperthyroidism), Coarctation of the aorta, Sleep apnea, and medication-induced hypertension (e.g., NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, decongestants).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Hypertensive Emergency:** Severe elevated blood pressure (typically >180/120 mmHg) accompanied by acute organ damage (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological deficits, acute kidney injury, visual changes). This requires immediate emergency treatment.
    *   **Hypertensive Urgency:** Severe elevated blood pressure (>180/120 mmHg) without evidence of acute organ damage. Requires prompt blood pressure reduction over hours to days.
    *   Symptoms suggestive of a secondary cause, such as sudden onset or worsening hypertension, young age of onset, resistant hypertension, palpitations, excessive sweating, muscle weakness, or signs of renal disease.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension). More specific codes may apply for secondary hypertension or hypertensive complications.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Initial workup:** Basic metabolic panel (serum electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, glucose), Lipid panel, Urinalysis (for proteinuria or hematuria), Electrocardiogram (EKG) (to assess for left ventricular hypertrophy or signs of ischemic heart disease).
    *   **Further investigations (if secondary hypertension is suspected):** Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Uric acid, Calcium, potentially imaging (renal ultrasound, CT/MRI of adrenal glands), or specific hormonal assays.

### **2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**

-   **Symptoms**: Often insidious in onset and may be asymptomatic for a long time. Common symptoms include polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and recurrent infections (e.g., skin, urinary tract, yeast infections). Unintentional weight loss can occur, though it's more characteristic of Type 1 diabetes.
-   **Demographics**: Typically diagnosed in individuals over 45, though increasing rates are seen in younger populations, including children and adolescents, often linked to rising obesity rates. Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are major risk factors. Family history significantly increases risk. Higher incidence is noted in Hispanic, Black, Indigenous, and Asian populations.
-   **Medications**:
    *   **First-line:** Metformin is generally the initial medication of choice, particularly for overweight or obese individuals, due to its efficacy, safety profile, and potential cardiovascular benefits.
    *   **Other commonly used:** GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide), SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., empagliflozin, canagliflozin) - these classes are increasingly used earlier, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, due to demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits. DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin), Sulfonylureas (e.g., glyburide, glipizide), Thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone), and Insulin (when oral medications are insufficient to achieve glycemic targets or in specific clinical situations). Medication selection is highly individualized based on glycemic control, comorbidities, risk of hypoglycemia, weight effects, and cost.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (usually presents acutely with more severe symptoms, often in younger individuals), Secondary diabetes (e.g., Cushing's syndrome, Hemochromatosis, Pancreatitis, certain medications like corticosteroids), Impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose (pre-diabetes).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Unintentional and significant weight loss, particularly if rapid; polyuria that is particularly noticeable at night (nocturia); frequent or severe infections; symptoms of hyperglycemia (severe thirst, frequent urination, high blood sugar readings) or impending diabetic ketoacidosis (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rapid breathing, fruity breath odor - more common in Type 1 but can occur in Type 2 under stress or severe illness); symptoms of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (severe dehydration, confusion, high blood sugar without significant ketosis).
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications). More specific codes exist for diabetes with complications (e.g., renal, neurological, ophthalmic) or if insulin dependent.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Fasting plasma glucose, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (reflects average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months), Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (less commonly used in routine primary care but can be helpful for diagnosis or in pregnancy), Urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio (to screen for diabetic kidney disease), Lipid panel (diabetes is a significant risk factor for dyslipidemia), Basic metabolic panel (to assess renal function and electrolytes).

### **3. Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)**

-   **Symptoms**: A constellation of symptoms affecting the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Common symptoms include sore throat, rhinorrhea (runny nose), nasal congestion, cough (initially dry, can become productive), low-grade fever (more common in children), sneezing, malaise, mild headache, and myalgias. Symptoms typically peak within a few days and gradually resolve.
-   **Demographics**: Affects all age groups, but incidence is higher in children and the elderly. Often has seasonal variation, with increased prevalence during fall and winter months. Transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and direct contact.
-   **Medications**: Treatment is primarily symptomatic as most URTIs are viral.
    *   **Symptomatic Relief:** Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain. Decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine) for nasal congestion (use with caution in patients with hypertension or heart disease). Antihistamines for rhinorrhea and sneezing. Cough suppressants (for dry cough) or expectorants (for productive cough) may be used, although evidence for their efficacy can be mixed. Nasal saline sprays can help with congestion.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Avoided unless there is strong suspicion of a bacterial superinfection (e.g., bacterial sinusitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia). Most URTIs are viral and do not respond to antibiotics.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Influenza (often presents with more abrupt onset, higher fever, and more severe myalgias), Streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat - bacterial infection with characteristic tonsillar exudates, fever, and absence of cough), Allergic rhinitis (chronic or seasonal symptoms triggered by allergens, often with itching, sneezing, and watery eyes, typically without fever), Sinusitis (bacterial sinusitis should be considered if symptoms, particularly nasal discharge and cough, persist for over 10-14 days or worsen after initial improvement, especially with facial pain or high fever), Bronchitis, Pneumonia (lower respiratory tract infection, usually with higher fever, significant cough with sputum, shortness of breath, and often abnormal chest X-ray), Mononucleosis, COVID-19.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Dyspnea (shortness of breath) or difficulty breathing:** May indicate pneumonia or other lower respiratory tract involvement.
    *   **Stridor (high-pitched whistling sound during breathing) or drooling:** Can be signs of epiglottitis or peritonsillar abscess, which are medical emergencies.
    *   **Persistent high fever (>5 days):** May suggest a bacterial infection like pneumonia or sinusitis.
    *   **Neck stiffness or severe headache with fever:** Could indicate meningitis.
    *   **Hemoptysis (coughing up blood):** Requires investigation to rule out more serious conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J06.9 (Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified). More specific codes exist for infections of specific sites (e.g., rhinitis, pharyngitis).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history and physical examination. Laboratory tests are generally not required for uncomplicated URTIs.
    *   **May be considered if differential diagnoses are suspected:** Rapid strep test or throat culture (for suspected streptococcal pharyngitis), Influenza swab or rapid influenza diagnostic test (if influenza is suspected, especially during flu season), Chest X-ray (if pneumonia is suspected based on symptoms and examination).

### **4. Major Depressive Disorder**

-   **Symptoms**: Persistent sad, empty, or irritable mood, often accompanied by anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in activities previously enjoyed). Other symptoms include significant changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia), fatigue or low energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, difficulty concentrating, indecisiveness, restlessness or slowed movements, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Symptoms must be present for at least two weeks and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning.
-   **Demographics**: Can affect individuals of any age, but the peak age of onset is typically between 25 and 49. More commonly diagnosed in females than males, with a ratio of approximately 2:1.
-   **Medications**:
    *   **First-line:** Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., sertraline, fluoxetine, escitalopram) are commonly the initial choice due to their efficacy and generally favorable side effect profile.
    *   **Other commonly used:** Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine), Atypical antidepressants (e.g., bupropion, mirtazapine), Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (less commonly used first-line due to side effects but can be effective), Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) (less commonly used, often for refractory depression, require dietary restrictions).
    *   **Adjunctive Therapy:** Psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)) is a crucial component of treatment, often used in conjunction with medication.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Bipolar disorder (characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania in addition to depressive episodes), Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia - chronic low-grade depression), Adjustment disorder with depressed mood (in response to a specific stressor), Hypothyroidism (can cause symptoms mimicking depression), Anemia (can cause fatigue and low energy), Chronic fatigue syndrome, Grief reactions, Substance abuse, other medical conditions (e.g., neurological disorders, vitamin deficiencies).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Suicidal ideation or behavior:** Any mention of wanting to harm oneself requires immediate assessment and appropriate safety measures, potentially including urgent psychiatric referral or hospitalization.
    *   **Psychosis:** Presence of hallucinations or delusions (e.g., nihilistic delusions, delusions of guilt) in the context of depression indicates severe depression and necessitates urgent psychiatric evaluation.
    *   **Self-harm:** Evidence of self-injurious behavior requires immediate attention and assessment of suicidal risk.
    *   **Unexplained significant weight loss or severe fatigue:** While symptoms of depression, these can also be red flags for underlying organic causes or malignancy.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of bipolar disorder:** History of manic or hypomanic episodes.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified). More specific codes exist for single or recurrent episodes and specifiers regarding severity (mild, moderate, severe) and features (with psychotic features, melancholic features, atypical features).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on psychiatric history and mental status examination. Laboratory tests are mainly used to rule out other conditions that can mimic depression.
    *   **Common tests to consider:** Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (to rule out hypothyroidism), Complete Blood Count (CBC) (to check for anemia), Vitamin D levels, Vitamin B12 levels, Folate levels, potentially toxicology screen if substance use is suspected.

### **5. Osteoarthritis**

-   **Symptoms**: Characterized by joint pain that typically worsens with activity and is relieved by rest. Other symptoms include joint stiffness (especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity, usually lasting less than 30 minutes), crepitus (a grating or crackling sound or sensation in the joint with movement), limited range of motion, and occasional joint swelling, particularly during flares. Commonly affected joints include knees, hips, hands (DIP and PIP joints, base of thumb), spine, and feet.
-   **Demographics**: The most common form of arthritis, with prevalence increasing significantly with age, particularly after 60. More common in postmenopausal women than men. Other risk factors include obesity, previous joint injury or trauma, overuse of joints (e.g., in certain occupations or sports), and a genetic predisposition.
-   **Medications**: Management is often multimodal, including non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches.
    *   **Non-pharmacological:** Weight loss (especially for knee and hip OA), exercise (range of motion, strengthening, aerobic), physical therapy, occupational therapy, heat and cold therapy, bracing or assistive devices.
    *   **Pharmacological (for pain relief):** Acetaminophen is often recommended as a first-line oral analgesic for mild to moderate pain. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib) are effective for pain and inflammation, used orally or topically. Topical NSAIDs may be preferred for localized OA, particularly in the knees and hands, due to lower systemic side effect risk. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections can provide short-term pain relief for moderate to severe joint pain. Other options include duloxetine (an SNRI also indicated for chronic musculoskeletal pain) and tramadol. Opioids are generally avoided due to risks.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Rheumatoid arthritis (inflammatory arthritis with symmetrical joint involvement, prominent morning stiffness lasting over an hour, and systemic symptoms), Gout (acute inflammatory arthritis typically affecting a single joint, often the base of the big toe, with severe pain, swelling, redness, and warmth), Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, similar to gout but with different crystal composition), Septic arthritis (bacterial infection of a joint, presenting with acute onset of severe pain, swelling, redness, warmth, and often fever and systemic symptoms), Fibromyalgia (widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in specific points), Bursitis, Tendinitis, Seronegative spondyloarthropathies.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Acute onset of severe joint pain with marked swelling, warmth, and erythema (redness):** Highly suggestive of septic arthritis (a medical emergency) or acute gout.
    *   **Fever or systemic toxicity accompanying joint symptoms:** Raises suspicion for septic arthritis or other systemic inflammatory conditions.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss or fever in the setting of joint pain:** Could indicate malignancy or infection.
    *   Rapidly progressive joint destruction or deformity (can occur in severe OA but also in other conditions like septic arthritis or certain inflammatory arthropathies).
-   **ICD-10 Code**: M19.90 (Osteoarthritis, unspecified site). More specific codes exist for osteoarthritis of specific joints (e.g., knee, hip, hand).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history, physical examination, and characteristic radiographic findings (joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, cysts).
    *   **Laboratory tests are often used to rule out other conditions:** Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (usually normal in uncomplicated OA but elevated in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or septic arthritis), Synovial fluid analysis (if joint effusion is present, to rule out infection or crystal-induced arthritis - involves aspirating fluid from the joint for cell count, crystal analysis, and culture). Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies (for suspected rheumatoid arthritis). Serum uric acid (for suspected gout, although normal levels do not rule out acute gout).

### **6. Rheumatoid Arthritis**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the synovium (joint lining). Classic presentation includes symmetrical joint pain and swelling, most commonly affecting the small joints of the hands (PIP and MCP joints) and feet, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees. A hallmark symptom is morning stiffness lasting for more than one hour. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue, low-grade fever, malaise, and unintended weight loss are also common. Over time, can lead to joint damage and deformity. Extra-articular manifestations can affect organs like the skin (rheumatoid nodules), eyes, lungs, heart, and blood vessels.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age, but onset is most common between 30 and 60 years. More prevalent in females than males, with a ratio of approximately 3:1. Genetic predisposition (e.g., presence of HLA-DRB1 alleles) and environmental factors (e.g., smoking) play a role.
-   **Medications**: Treatment aims to reduce inflammation, alleviate symptoms, prevent joint damage, and improve function. Early and aggressive treatment is often recommended.
    *   **Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs):** Methotrexate is often the first-line conventional synthetic DMARD. Other conventional DMARDs include sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine.
    *   **Biologic DMARDs:** (e.g., etanercept, adalimumab, rituximab, abatacept) are used when conventional DMARDs are insufficient or in patients with moderate to severe disease. These target specific components of the immune system.
    *   **Targeted Synthetic DMARDs:** (e.g., tofacitinib, baricitinib) are oral medications that target specific intracellular pathways.
    *   **Symptomatic Relief:** NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) are used to reduce pain and inflammation but do not alter disease progression. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) can be used for short periods during flares or as a bridge therapy when initiating DMARDs, but long-term use is limited by side effects.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Osteoarthritis (typically affects different joints, morning stiffness is shorter, less systemic symptoms), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE - another autoimmune disease that can cause joint pain but also affects multiple organ systems, often with characteristic rashes, photosensitivity, and hematological abnormalities), Psoriatic arthritis (inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, can affect joints asymmetrically or symmetrically, can involve the spine and entheses), Gout, Pseudogout, Reactive arthritis, Viral arthritis, Polymyalgia rheumatica (inflammatory condition causing muscle pain and stiffness, primarily in the shoulders and hips, in older adults).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Rapidly progressive joint pain, swelling, and loss of function:** While RA is chronic, a sudden worsening could indicate a flare or superimposed infection (septic arthritis).
    *   **Signs of extra-articular involvement impacting organ function:** Shortness of breath (interstitial lung disease), chest pain (pericarditis, increased cardiovascular risk), severe eye pain or vision changes (scleritis, uveitis), symptoms of vasculitis (skin ulcers, nerve damage).
    *   **Unexplained weight loss or persistent fever:** Can be symptoms of active RA but also warrant investigation for infection or malignancy.
    *   **Severe joint deformities developing rapidly.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: M06.9 (Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified). More specific codes exist based on the presence of rheumatoid factor and affected sites.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Key diagnostic tests:** Rheumatoid Factor (RF) (positive in about 80% of patients, but can be positive in other conditions and negative in early RA), Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies (more specific for RA than RF and can be positive early in the disease), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (markers of inflammation, typically elevated in active RA).
    *   **Other relevant tests:** Complete Blood Count (CBC) (may show anemia of chronic disease or thrombocytosis), Liver and renal function tests (important before starting certain DMARDs and for monitoring), Imaging studies (X-rays of affected joints to assess for joint damage, erosion, and joint space narrowing).

---

### **7. Migraine**

-   **Symptoms**: A type of headache characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate to severe, often unilateral, pulsating or throbbing head pain. Typically aggravated by physical activity. Often accompanied by associated symptoms such as nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). Some individuals experience an aura before the headache, which can involve visual disturbances (flashing lights, blind spots), sensory changes (numbness, tingling), or speech difficulties. Attacks can last from a few hours to several days.
-   **Demographics**: Most common between the ages of 18 and 44. More prevalent in females than males, with a ratio of approximately 3:1. Family history is a strong risk factor.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves both acute (abortive) treatment for individual attacks and prophylactic (preventive) treatment for frequent or severe migraines.
    *   **Acute Treatment:** Over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen) for mild to moderate migraines. Triptans (e.g., sumatriptan, zolmitriptan) are serotonin receptor agonists effective for moderate to severe migraines. Ditans (e.g., lasmiditan) and Gepants (e.g., ubrogepant, rimegepant) are newer classes for acute treatment. Anti-emetics (e.g., metoclopramide, ondansetron) to treat nausea and vomiting. Combination analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine).
    *   **Prophylactic Treatment (for frequent or debilitating migraines):** Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, metoprolol), Anticonvulsants (e.g., topiramate, valproic acid), CGRP inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies like erenumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab, and oral gepants like atogepant), Calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil), Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Tension-type headache (most common type, typically bilateral, non-pulsating, mild to moderate pain, not aggravated by activity, usually without nausea or vomiting, though photophobia or phonophobia can be present), Cluster headache (severe, strictly unilateral pain, often around the eye, occurring in clusters, associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms like nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, ptosis), Secondary headaches (headaches caused by underlying conditions, which must be ruled out, especially if the headache is sudden, severe, or associated with neurological symptoms).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Thunderclap headache:** A sudden, severe headache that reaches maximum intensity within seconds to minutes. This is a medical emergency and could indicate a subarachnoid hemorrhage or other serious intracranial pathology.
    *   **Headache with focal neurological deficits:** New onset of weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, visual loss, or other neurological symptoms that persist beyond the headache duration or occur without a typical migraine aura. Could indicate stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a structural brain lesion.
    *   **Headache with fever, neck stiffness, or rash:** Suggests meningitis or encephalitis.
    *   **Headache that is new or different in a patient with a history of cancer or immunocompromise.**
    *   **Headache that worsens with coughing, straining, or changes in position.**
    *   **Headache with papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve head):** Suggests increased intracranial pressure.
    *   **New onset headache in a patient over 50 years old, especially if associated with scalp tenderness or jaw claudication:** Could indicate giant cell arteritis, which requires urgent evaluation and treatment to prevent vision loss.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: G43.909 (Migraine, unspecified, not intractable, without status migrainosus or not otherwise classified). More specific codes exist based on the presence or absence of aura, intractability, and status migrainosus.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Neuroimaging (CT or MRI of the head) is not usually necessary for typical migraines but is indicated if red-flag symptoms are present or if the headache presentation is atypical.
    *   **May consider:** ESR (if giant cell arteritis is suspected in older patients).

---

### **8. Epilepsy**

-   **Symptoms**: Characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Seizures are transient occurrences of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Seizure types vary widely depending on the area of the brain affected and can include:
    *   **Focal seizures:** Originating in one area of the brain. Symptoms depend on the location and can include motor (jerking movements), sensory (unusual smells or tastes, tingling), autonomic (changes in heart rate, blood pressure), or cognitive (déjà vu, confusion) phenomena. Consciousness may be preserved or impaired.
    *   **Generalized seizures:** Involving widespread areas of the brain. Types include tonic-clonic (formerly grand mal - loss of consciousness, body stiffening, and rhythmic jerking), absence (formerly petit mal - brief愣神 spells, common in children), tonic (muscle stiffening), atonic (sudden loss of muscle tone), myoclonic (brief muscle jerks).
    *   **Post-ictal phase:** Period following a seizure, which can include confusion, drowsiness, headache, or focal weakness.
-   **Demographics**: Can begin at any age, with peaks in incidence in early childhood and in older adults. Causes vary with age (e.g., genetic or developmental in children, stroke or neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly).
-   **Medications**: Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs), also known as antiseizure medications, are the primary treatment to prevent seizures. The choice of AED depends on the seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, potential side effects, comorbidities, age, and gender (e.g., considerations for women of childbearing potential).
    *   **Commonly prescribed AEDs:** Levetiracetam, Lamotrigine, Valproic acid, Carbamazepine, Oxcarbazepine, Phenytoin, Topiramate, Gabapentin, Pregabalin. Newer AEDs are also available and often used for specific seizure types or when older medications are not tolerated.
    *   **Other treatments:** Vagal nerve stimulation, ketogenic diet, and epilepsy surgery may be options for some individuals with refractory epilepsy.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Syncope (fainting - transient loss of consciousness due to reduced blood flow to the brain, often triggered by specific events like standing up quickly, fear, or pain; usually shorter duration than seizures and lacks the typical motor manifestations of generalized seizures), Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES - events that resemble epileptic seizures but are psychological in origin), Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar can cause confusion, shaking, and even loss of consciousness), Cardiac arrhythmias (can cause syncope or near-syncope), Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA - "mini-stroke" can cause transient neurological symptoms), Migraine with aura (especially complex auras), Sleep disorders (e.g., narcolepsy, sleep apnea), Movement disorders, Vertigo.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Status epilepticus:** A medical emergency defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness between them. Requires immediate medical intervention to prevent brain damage.
    *   **New-onset seizures in adults, particularly those over 50 years old:** While epilepsy can begin at any age, new onset in this age group warrants investigation to rule out underlying structural brain lesions (e.g., tumor, stroke) or metabolic causes.
    *   **Seizures associated with focal neurological deficits that persist after the seizure.**
    *   **Headache, fever, or neck stiffness accompanying seizures:** Suggests central nervous system infection (meningitis, encephalitis).
    *   **History of head trauma, stroke, or brain tumor.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: G40.909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus). More specific codes exist for different seizure types and epilepsy syndromes, as well as intractability and status epilepticus.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** Records electrical activity in the brain and can help identify abnormal seizure patterns and classify epilepsy syndromes.
    *   **Neuroimaging (MRI of the brain is preferred):** To identify structural causes of seizures such as tumors, stroke lesions, malformations, or evidence of previous injury.
    *   **Laboratory blood tests:** Serum glucose (to rule out hypoglycemia), Electrolytes (imbalances can trigger seizures), Calcium, Magnesium, Renal and liver function tests (baseline before starting AEDs and for monitoring), Toxicology screen (to rule out substance use or withdrawal). Lumbar puncture may be necessary if CNS infection is suspected.

### **9. Hypothyroidism**

-   **Symptoms**: Caused by insufficient production of thyroid hormones. Symptoms are often non-specific and develop gradually. Common symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, brittle nails, muscle aches and weakness, joint pain, slowed heart rate (bradycardia), depression, impaired memory and concentration ("brain fog"), and menstrual irregularities in women. Severe, long-standing hypothyroidism can lead to myxedema, characterized by puffiness of the face and hands, thickening of the skin, and deepening of the voice.
-   **Demographics**: More common in females than males and prevalence increases with age, particularly over 60. Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) is the most common cause in iodine-sufficient areas. Other causes include iodine deficiency (more common globally), thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, certain medications (e.g., amiodarone, lithium), and central hypothyroidism (problems with the pituitary or hypothalamus).
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
    *   **First-line:** Levothyroxine (synthetic T4) is the standard treatment. The dose is individualized and adjusted based on TSH levels.
    *   Other preparations, such as liothyronine (synthetic T3) or combination therapy (T4 and T3), are used less commonly and in specific circumstances.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Depression (many overlapping symptoms, but hypothyroidism should be ruled out in patients presenting with depressive symptoms), Anemia (can cause fatigue and pallor), Chronic fatigue syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Menopause (in women, symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and mood changes can overlap), Medication side effects.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Myxedema coma:** A rare but life-threatening complication of severe, untreated hypothyroidism, characterized by severe hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoventilation, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and altered mental status or coma. Requires immediate intensive care.
    *   **Rapidly enlarging goiter or associated compressive symptoms (difficulty swallowing or breathing, hoarseness):** Could indicate thyroid malignancy or a rapidly growing benign goiter requiring assessment.
    *   Symptoms of associated autoimmune conditions (e.g., adrenal insufficiency - rare but life-threatening if missed in the context of autoimmune hypothyroidism).
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E03.9 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different causes of hypothyroidism (e.g., autoimmune thyroiditis, post-surgical hypothyroidism).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH):** The most sensitive initial test for primary hypothyroidism. An elevated TSH indicates that the pituitary gland is trying to stimulate a sluggish thyroid.
    *   **Free Thyroxine (Free T4):** Measures the amount of active thyroid hormone in the blood. Typically low in overt hypothyroidism.
    *   **Thyroid antibodies (e.g., anti-TPO antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies):** Can help identify autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) as the cause.
    *   **Other tests to consider based on symptoms or differential diagnoses:** Complete Blood Count (CBC), Lipid panel (hypothyroidism can cause hyperlipidemia), Basic metabolic panel.

### **10. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**

-   **Symptoms**: A common endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women characterized by a combination of signs and symptoms related to hormonal imbalance and metabolic dysfunction. Key features include menstrual irregularities (oligomenorrhea - infrequent periods, or amenorrhea - absence of periods), hyperandrogenism (excess levels of male hormones, leading to symptoms like hirsutism - excessive hair growth, acne, and sometimes male-pattern baldness), and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries containing multiple small follicles). Patients may also experience weight gain, difficulty losing weight, and insulin resistance.
-   **Demographics**: Affects reproductive-age females, typically diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood. Exact prevalence varies but is estimated to affect 5-10% of women in this age group. Often has a genetic component and can run in families. Obesity is common in women with PCOS and can worsen symptoms, but PCOS can also occur in lean individuals.
-   **Medications**: Management is tailored to the individual's primary concerns (e.g., menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, infertility, metabolic issues).
    *   **First-line for menstrual irregularities and hirsutism:** Combined oral contraceptives help regulate periods and reduce androgen levels.
    *   **For insulin resistance and often used for menstrual regulation and improving fertility:** Metformin can improve insulin sensitivity, help regulate menstrual cycles, and may contribute to modest weight loss.
    *   **For hirsutism:** Anti-androgen medications (e.g., spironolactone) can be used, often in combination with oral contraceptives.
    *   **For infertility:** Clomiphene citrate or letrozole to induce ovulation; sometimes gonadotropins or IVF.
    *   **Lifestyle modifications:** Weight loss (even modest weight loss can significantly improve symptoms and metabolic parameters), healthy diet, and regular exercise are crucial.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Thyroid dysfunction (hypo- or hyperthyroidism can cause menstrual irregularities), Hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin levels can cause menstrual irregularities and galactorrhea), Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (late-onset forms can mimic PCOS with hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularities), Cushing's syndrome (rare, but can cause weight gain, menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and striae), Androgen-secreting tumors (rare, but should be considered in cases of rapid onset or severe hyperandrogenism), Primary ovarian insufficiency, Hypothalamic amenorrhea.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Rapid onset of severe hirsutism or other signs of virilization (e.g., deepening voice, increased muscle mass, clitoral enlargement):** Could indicate a more serious underlying cause of hyperandrogenism, such as an androgen-secreting tumor.
    *   **Rapid weight gain, central obesity, easy bruising, wide purple striae, and proximal muscle weakness:** Suggestive of Cushing's syndrome.
    *   **Presence of a pelvic mass on examination or imaging:** While polycystic ovaries are characteristic, a large or suspicious ovarian mass requires further investigation to rule out ovarian tumors.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E28.2 (Polycystic ovary syndrome).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Diagnosis is based on clinical features, hormonal assays, and ultrasound findings (Rotterdam criteria are commonly used).
    *   **Hormonal assays:** Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (LH/FSH ratio may be elevated in PCOS, but this is not always present), Total and free testosterone (elevated in hyperandrogenism), Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) (another androgen that can be elevated), Prolactin (to rule out hyperprolactinemia), TSH (to rule out thyroid dysfunction).
    *   **Metabolic screening:** Fasting glucose and HbA1c (to screen for impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes), Lipid panel (dyslipidemia is common in PCOS).
    *   **Imaging:** Pelvic ultrasound to assess ovarian morphology (presence of multiple small follicles). Endometrial thickness may also be assessed if there is prolonged amenorrhea to evaluate for endometrial hyperplasia.

### **11. Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition characterized by intense pruritus (itching), erythematous (red) patches and plaques, scaling, and sometimes vesicles or oozing. The appearance and distribution vary with age. In infants, it often presents on the face, scalp, and extensor surfaces of limbs. In children and adults, it typically affects the flexural areas (antecubital and popliteal fossae), neck, wrists, and ankles. The skin is often dry and sensitive. Scratching can lead to lichenification (thickening of the skin) and excoriations.
-   **Demographics**: Most commonly begins in infancy or early childhood, often improving with age, but can persist into adulthood or begin in adulthood. Frequently associated with a personal or family history of atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergies). More common in urban areas and developed countries.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on reducing inflammation, alleviating itching, repairing the skin barrier, and preventing flares.
    *   **Topical therapy:** Emollients and moisturizers are fundamental for all patients to hydrate the skin and improve barrier function. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay for reducing inflammation during flares, used in varying potencies depending on the severity and location. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) are alternative anti-inflammatory agents, particularly useful for sensitive areas like the face and eyelids, and for maintenance therapy.
    *   **Systemic therapy (for severe or refractory eczema):** Phototherapy (UV light therapy), Systemic corticosteroids (for severe flares, but long-term use is avoided), Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine), Biologics (e.g., dupilumab - targets IL-4 and IL-13, key cytokines in atopic inflammation).
    *   **Other:** Antihistamines (for itching, particularly sedating ones at night), Antibiotics (if secondary bacterial infection is suspected).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Contact dermatitis (allergic or irritant - localized reaction to a substance, often with a clear border), Psoriasis (sharply demarcated erythematous plaques with thick silvery scale, typically on extensor surfaces, scalp, and nails), Seborrheic dermatitis (scaling and redness in areas with high sebaceous gland activity like the scalp, face, and chest), Scabies (intensely itchy rash, often with burrows, particularly in intertriginous areas, highly contagious), Fungal infections (e.g., tinea corporis - ringworm, typically with annular lesions), Ichthyosis (genetic disorders causing dry, scaly skin), Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (rare, can mimic eczema-like patches).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Erythroderma:** Widespread redness and scaling covering most of the body surface, often with systemic symptoms like fever, chills, and malaise. Can be a severe exacerbation of eczema or indicate another serious skin condition or systemic illness.
    *   **Signs of secondary bacterial infection (impetiginization):** Golden-yellow crusts, pus, increasing pain, fever. Commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
    *   **Signs of viral infection (Eczema herpeticum):** Numerous monomorphic vesicles or punched-out erosions in the areas of eczema, often with pain, fever, and malaise. Caused by Herpes Simplex Virus and is a medical emergency.
    *   **Failure to respond to appropriate therapy or atypical presentation:** May warrant further investigation or biopsy to rule out other diagnoses.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: L20.9 (Atopic dermatitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different types of dermatitis and affected sites.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis.
    *   **May be considered in atypical cases or to identify triggers/complications:** Skin scraping or fungal culture (to rule out fungal infection), Bacterial culture (if secondary bacterial infection is suspected), Patch testing (if allergic contact dermatitis is suspected as a trigger or co-factor), Serum IgE levels and allergy testing (skin prick testing or specific IgE blood tests - may help identify aeroallergens or food allergens that can exacerbate eczema, particularly in severe cases or when allergic triggers are suspected).

### **12. Psoriasis**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the skin, characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with thick silvery scales. Commonly affects the elbows, knees, scalp, lower back, and nails. Psoriatic arthritis, an inflammatory arthritis affecting joints, occurs in a significant percentage of patients with psoriasis and can cause joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Other subtypes of psoriasis exist, including guttate (small, drop-like lesions), inverse (in skin folds), pustular (pus-filled blisters), and erythrodermic (widespread redness and scaling). Psoriasis is also associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age but has two peaks of onset: one between 15 and 35 years and a second in the late 50s or early 60s. Affects males and females equally. There is a strong genetic predisposition.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the severity and extent of the disease, as well as the presence of psoriatic arthritis.
    *   **Topical therapy (for mild to moderate disease):** Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay, used in varying potencies. Vitamin D analogs (e.g., calcipotriene), Topical retinoids (e.g., tazarotene), Coal tar, Anthralin, Calcineurin inhibitors (for sensitive areas).
    *   **Phototherapy (for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis):** UVB or PUVA (psoralen plus UVA light).
    *   **Systemic therapy (for moderate to severe disease or psoriatic arthritis):** Methotrexate, Cyclosporine, Acitretin (a retinoid).
    *   **Biologics (for moderate to severe disease or psoriatic arthritis unresponsive to conventional therapy):** Target specific cytokines or immune cells involved in psoriasis pathogenesis (e.g., TNF-alpha inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors, IL-23 inhibitors).
    *   **Targeted Synthetic DMARDs (for psoriatic arthritis):** (e.g., tofacitinib, apremilast).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Seborrheic dermatitis (scaling and redness in seborrheic areas, less well-demarcated than psoriasis), Eczema (itchy, less well-demarcated, typically in flexural areas), Lichen planus (itchy, purple, polygonal papules and plaques, can affect skin, mouth, nails, and genitals), Pityriasis rosea (acute eruption of oval, scaly patches, often preceded by a "herald patch"), Fungal infections (e.g., tinea corporis), Secondary syphilis (can present with a rash that mimics psoriasis), Drug eruptions.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Pustular psoriasis:** A severe, rare form characterized by widespread pustules, often with fever and systemic symptoms. Can be generalized (Von Zumbusch) or localized (palms and soles). Requires urgent medical attention.
    *   **Erythrodermic psoriasis:** Widespread redness and scaling covering most of the body surface, often with systemic symptoms. Can be life-threatening due to fluid and electrolyte imbalances and temperature dysregulation.
    *   **Arthritis mutilans:** A severe, deforming form of psoriatic arthritis that can lead to significant joint damage and shortening of digits. Requires aggressive management.
    *   **New onset or worsening joint pain in a patient with psoriasis:** Suggests development or flare of psoriatic arthritis.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss or fever:** While systemic inflammation can occur in severe psoriasis, these symptoms warrant investigation for infection or malignancy.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: L40.9 (Psoriasis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different types of psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Skin biopsy can be performed in atypical cases to confirm the diagnosis.
    *   **If psoriatic arthritis is suspected:** Rheumatoid factor (typically negative in psoriatic arthritis, which is why it's a seronegative spondyloarthropathy), ESR and CRP (may be elevated in active arthritis), Imaging (X-rays of affected joints to assess for characteristic changes of psoriatic arthritis).

### **13. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**

-   **Symptoms**: An age-related non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland, which can cause bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Symptoms are typically obstructive and irritative.
    *   **Obstructive symptoms:** Weak or slow urinary stream, difficulty initiating urination (hesitancy), straining to urinate, intermittent stream, feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, post-void dribbling.
    *   **Irritative symptoms:** Increased urinary frequency, urgency (a sudden strong urge to urinate), nocturia (waking up at night to urinate).
-   **Demographics**: Very common in aging men, with prevalence increasing significantly after age 50. The risk increases with age.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the presence of complications.
    *   **Lifestyle modifications:** Reducing fluid intake before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, particularly in the evening, timely voiding.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   **Alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin):** Relax the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow. Often provide rapid symptom relief.
        *   **5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride):** Block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is involved in prostate growth. These medications shrink the prostate gland and are more effective in men with larger prostates. They take longer to work than alpha-blockers (several months).
        *   **Combination therapy:** Combining an alpha-blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor may be more effective for some men with larger prostates and more severe symptoms.
        *   Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors (e.g., tadalafil) may also be used to treat BPH symptoms, particularly in men with concomitant erectile dysfunction.
    *   **Surgical interventions:** (e.g., Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), laser surgery) may be necessary for men with severe symptoms, complications, or those who do not respond to medical therapy.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Prostate cancer (can cause similar LUTS, though often asymptomatic in early stages), Urinary tract infection (UTI - can cause irritative symptoms like frequency and urgency, often with dysuria and sometimes hematuria), Neurogenic bladder (bladder dysfunction due to neurological conditions like stroke, spinal cord injury, or multiple sclerosis), Urethral stricture, Bladder stones, Overactive bladder (primarily urgency and frequency, often without significant obstructive symptoms).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Hematuria (blood in the urine):** While BPH can sometimes cause microscopic hematuria, gross hematuria (visible blood) or persistent microscopic hematuria warrants investigation to rule out malignancy (prostate, bladder, kidney cancer) or stones.
    *   **Acute urinary retention:** Inability to void, causing significant discomfort and bladder distension. Requires urgent catheterization.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of prostate cancer metastasis:** Bone pain (especially in the back, hips, or pelvis), unexplained weight loss.
    *   **Renal insufficiency or hydronephrosis on imaging:** Can occur in severe, long-standing BPH due to urinary obstruction.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N40.1 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms). More specific codes exist for BPH without LUTS or with other complications.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA):** A blood test that can be elevated in BPH, but also in prostate cancer, prostatitis, and other conditions. Used in conjunction with digital rectal examination (DRE) to screen for prostate cancer. Shared decision-making with patients regarding PSA screening is important.
    *   **Urinalysis and urine culture:** To rule out urinary tract infection or hematuria.
    *   **Renal function tests (serum creatinine, BUN):** To assess for kidney impairment due to potential chronic obstruction.
    *   **Other tests:** Post-void residual volume (ultrasound or catheterization to measure the amount of urine left in the bladder after voiding - elevated in significant obstruction), Uroflowmetry (measures the speed and force of the urine stream).

### **14. Breast Cancer Screening**

-   **Symptoms**: Breast cancer in its early stages may be asymptomatic and detected through screening. When symptoms are present, they can include: a new lump or mass in the breast or armpit (often painless, firm, and irregular), changes in the size or shape of the breast, skin changes (dimpling, puckering, redness, scaling), nipple changes (inversion, discharge - especially if bloody or unilateral, redness, scaling), and breast pain (less common symptom).
-   **Demographics**: Primarily affects females, with risk increasing with age, particularly after 40. Family history of breast cancer (especially in a first-degree relative), certain genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1 and BRCA2), personal history of certain benign breast conditions, early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity or first full-term pregnancy after age 30, never breastfeeding, obesity, alcohol consumption, and hormone replacement therapy are risk factors. Can also occur in males, though much less common.
-   **Medications/Interventions**: Screening involves modalities to detect breast cancer before symptoms develop. Preventive medications may be used in high-risk individuals.
    *   **Screening:** Mammography is the primary screening tool for average-risk women, typically starting at age 40 or 50, with varying recommendations on frequency (annual or biennial) depending on guidelines and individual risk factors. Breast ultrasound and breast MRI may be used in addition to mammography in certain high-risk individuals (e.g., those with BRCA mutations, strong family history, or dense breast tissue). Clinical breast examination and breast self-examination are also components of breast health awareness.
    *   **Preventive Medications (for high-risk individuals):** Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) (e.g., tamoxifen, raloxifene) or aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole, exemestane) may be prescribed to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women at high risk.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Fibroadenoma (common benign solid breast tumor, often smooth, mobile, and rubbery), Breast cyst (fluid-filled sac, often feels smooth and movable, can be tender), Mastitis (inflammation of the breast tissue, often due to infection, causing pain, redness, swelling, and warmth, often associated with breastfeeding), Breast abscess (a localized collection of pus), Fat necrosis (lump formed by damaged fatty tissue), Sclerosing adenosis (benign proliferative lesion).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **A new, fixed, irregular, and painless lump or mass in the breast or axilla:** While not all cancers are painless or irregular, these features raise a high suspicion for malignancy.
    *   **Unilateral, spontaneous, bloody, or clear nipple discharge:** Can be a sign of underlying malignancy or papilloma.
    *   **Skin changes suggestive of inflammatory breast cancer:** Redness, warmth, swelling, and a pitted appearance resembling an orange peel (peau d'orange). This is an aggressive form of breast cancer.
    *   **Nipple retraction or inversion that is new.**
    *   **Bone pain, unexplained weight loss, or jaundice:** Suggestive of metastatic breast cancer.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: Z12.31 (Encounter for screening mammogram for malignant neoplasm of breast). Codes for breast lumps, pain, or other symptoms are used when the patient presents with those concerns, not for routine screening.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Screening is primarily based on imaging.
    *   **If a suspicious lesion is found on screening or clinical examination:** Diagnostic mammography, Breast ultrasound, and ultimately Biopsy (fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy) to obtain tissue for histological examination and confirm the diagnosis.

### **15. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)**

-   **Symptoms**: A progressive respiratory disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation. Encompasses chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Common symptoms include chronic cough (often productive of sputum), exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath that worsens with activity), and wheezing. Symptoms typically worsen over time. Patients may experience exacerbations, which are acute worsening of respiratory symptoms.
-   **Demographics**: Primarily affects individuals over 40 years old, strongly associated with a history of smoking (current or past). Other risk factors include exposure to occupational dusts and chemicals, indoor air pollution (e.g., biomass fuel smoke), and a genetic deficiency (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency - a less common cause, particularly in younger individuals with COPD). More common in males historically, but prevalence in females is increasing.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on symptom relief, preventing exacerbations, and improving quality of life. There is no cure for COPD.
    *   **Bronchodilators:** Inhaled bronchodilators are central to symptom management.
        *   Short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) (e.g., albuterol) or short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs) (e.g., ipratropium) for as-needed relief of breathlessness.
        *   Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) (e.g., tiotropium, umeclidinium) are used regularly to reduce symptoms and exacerbations in patients with more persistent symptoms.
    *   **Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS):** Often used in combination with LABAs (LABA/ICS inhalers) for patients with frequent exacerbations or more severe disease. Not typically used as monotherapy in COPD.
    *   **Other medications:** Roflumilast (a PDE4 inhibitor for severe COPD with chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations), Azithromycin (as prophylactic therapy in select patients with frequent exacerbations), Supplemental oxygen therapy (for patients with chronic hypoxemia).
    *   **Pulmonary Rehabilitation:** A crucial non-pharmacological intervention to improve exercise tolerance and quality of life.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Asthma (typically has reversible airflow limitation, often with onset in childhood, symptoms vary day-to-day), Heart failure (can cause dyspnea, cough, and wheezing, but usually with signs and symptoms of fluid overload like peripheral edema and orthopnea; chest X-ray and echocardiogram help differentiate), Bronchiectasis (chronic cough with copious purulent sputum, often associated with recurrent infections and characteristic changes on HRCT scan), Tuberculosis, Lung cancer, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (should be considered in younger patients with COPD or those with a family history).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Acute exacerbation of COPD:** Acute worsening of respiratory symptoms (increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence) that requires a change in medication. Severe exacerbations can lead to respiratory failure and require hospitalization.
    *   **Hemoptysis (coughing up blood):** While can occur in severe chronic bronchitis, always warrants investigation to rule out lung cancer or bronchiectasis.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss or new onset of chest pain:** Raises suspicion for underlying lung cancer.
    *   **Significant hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels):** May require hospitalization and supplemental oxygen.
    *   **Signs of right heart failure (cor pulmonale):** Peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly, in the context of severe lung disease.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified). More specific codes exist for COPD with acute exacerbation or with specific features like emphysema or chronic bronchitis.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Spirometry:** Essential for diagnosis and assessment of severity, demonstrating airflow limitation that is not fully reversible (FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.70 post-bronchodilator).
    *   **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):** To assess for hypoxemia and hypercapnia (elevated CO2), particularly in more severe disease or during exacerbations.
    *   **Chest X-ray:** May show hyperinflation or bullae in emphysema, or thickened bronchial walls in chronic bronchitis. Helpful in ruling out other causes of respiratory symptoms like pneumonia or heart failure.
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** May show polycythemia (increased red blood cell count) in response to chronic hypoxemia.
    *   **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin level:** Should be measured in patients diagnosed with COPD, especially if young, non-smokers, or with a family history of early-onset COPD.

### **16. Asthma**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation, and increased mucus production. Common symptoms include recurrent episodes of wheezing (a whistling sound during breathing, especially exhalation), dyspnea (shortness of breath), chest tightness, and cough (often worse at night or in the early morning, and triggered by exercise, cold air, allergens, or respiratory infections). Symptoms can vary in severity and frequency.
-   **Demographics**: Often begins in childhood but can develop at any age. Frequently associated with a personal or family history of atopy (eczema, allergic rhinitis). Other risk factors include respiratory infections in early life, exposure to allergens, irritants (e.g., smoke), and occupational exposures. Can be more severe and have higher mortality in certain populations.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on controlling inflammation, relieving bronchoconstriction, preventing exacerbations, and maintaining normal lung function. Treatment is guided by asthma severity and control.
    *   **Reliever Medications:** Short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) (e.g., albuterol) are used for quick relief of asthma symptoms.
    *   **Controller Medications:**
        *   Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide) are the cornerstone of persistent asthma management, reducing airway inflammation.
        *   Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol) are used in combination with ICS for patients whose asthma is not well-controlled on ICS alone (LABA/ICS inhalers). LABAs should not be used as monotherapy in asthma.
        *   Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast) can be used as alternative or add-on therapy, particularly for exercise-induced asthma or allergic rhinitis.
        *   Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) (e.g., tiotropium) may be added for severe asthma.
    *   **Other medications:** Systemic corticosteroids (for moderate to severe exacerbations), Biologics (e.g., omalizumab, mepolizumab - for severe allergic or eosinophilic asthma), Bronchial thermoplasty (procedure for severe, refractory asthma).
    *   **Asthma Action Plan:** A written plan is essential for patients to manage their asthma, including adjusting medications based on symptoms and peak flow readings and recognizing when to seek urgent care.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: COPD (more common in smokers, less reversible airflow limitation), Vocal cord dysfunction (paradoxical movement of the vocal cords during breathing, can mimic asthma, often triggered by exercise or irritants), Heart failure, Bronchiectasis, Pulmonary embolism, Foreign body aspiration (especially in children), Anxiety or panic attacks (can cause shortness of breath and chest tightness, but usually without wheezing or cough).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Status asthmaticus:** A severe, prolonged asthma exacerbation that does not respond to initial bronchodilator therapy. Characterized by severe dyspnea, wheezing (may be absent in very severe obstruction - "silent chest"), use of accessory muscles, difficulty speaking, and often hypoxemia. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment, often in an emergency setting or ICU.
    *   **Hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels):** Indicated by pulse oximetry or ABG. A significant drop in oxygen saturation is a sign of a severe exacerbation.
    *   **Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin or lips):** A late and ominous sign of severe hypoxemia.
    *   **Inability to speak in full sentences due to breathlessness.**
    *   **Decreased level of consciousness or exhaustion.**
    *   **Paradoxical respiration (abdomen moves inward with inspiration):** Indicates severe respiratory muscle fatigue.
    *   **Peak expiratory flow (PEF) significantly below the patient's personal best or predicted value.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J45.909 (Asthma, unspecified, uncomplicated status asthmaticus). More specific codes exist for different types and severity of asthma, and for asthma with exacerbations.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Spirometry:** Essential for diagnosis and monitoring of lung function, demonstrating reversible airflow limitation. May be performed before and after administration of a bronchodilator.
    *   **Peak Flow Monitoring:** Patients can use a peak flow meter at home to monitor their asthma control and detect early signs of worsening.
    *   **Chest X-ray:** Usually normal in uncomplicated asthma but may be done during an exacerbation to rule out complications like pneumonia or pneumothorax.
    *   **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO):** Can be used as a marker of airway inflammation in some cases.
    *   **Allergy testing:** Skin prick testing or specific IgE blood tests can help identify allergic triggers.

### **17. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/CFS or ME/CFS)**

-   **Symptoms**: A complex, debilitating chronic illness characterized by profound fatigue that is not explained by any underlying medical condition. The fatigue is not significantly relieved by rest and is worsened by physical or mental exertion (post-exertional malaise). Other common symptoms include impaired memory or concentration, orthostatic intolerance (worsening symptoms upon standing), unrefreshing sleep, muscle pain, joint pain without swelling or redness, headache, sore throat, and tender lymph nodes. Symptoms must be present for at least six months.
-   **Demographics**: Can affect individuals of any age, but most commonly diagnosed in adults, particularly women, between their 40s and 50s. The exact cause is unknown but may involve a combination of genetic predisposition, infections (viral or bacterial), immune system dysfunction, and stress.
-   **Medications**: There is no specific cure for ME/CFS, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and improving function.
    *   **Symptom Management:** Medications may be used to address specific symptoms such as pain (analgesics), sleep disturbances (sleep hygiene, sometimes sleep medications), orthostatic intolerance (e.g., fludrocortisone, midodrine), and mood disorders (antidepressants if depression is also present).
    *   **Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Historically used, but their role is now debated and GET is not recommended by some guidelines due to the risk of exacerbating post-exertional malaise. Pacing (managing activity levels to avoid post-exertional malaise) is a key strategy.
    *   **Management of comorbidities:** Treating co-occurring conditions like depression, anxiety, sleep apnea, or irritable bowel syndrome is important.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Hypothyroidism, Depression, Anemia, Sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea, narcolepsy), Fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, Mononucleosis, Other chronic infections (e.g., HIV, hepatitis), Autoimmune diseases (e.g., SLE, Sjogren's syndrome), Malignancy, Side effects of medications, Substance abuse. Ruling out other treatable medical conditions is essential before diagnosing ME/CFS.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** While some individuals with ME/CFS may experience weight changes due to altered activity or appetite, significant and unexplained weight loss is a red flag for malignancy or other serious underlying conditions.
    *   **Night sweats:** Can occur in some chronic conditions but also a potential symptom of infection or malignancy.
    *   **Focal neurological deficits:** Weakness, numbness, vision changes, etc., require investigation to rule out neurological diseases.
    *   **Abnormal physical examination findings or laboratory results that suggest an alternative diagnosis.**
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of inflammatory conditions:** Significant joint swelling, persistent high fever.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: R53.82 (Chronic fatigue, unspecified). Note: There is ongoing discussion and debate about the most appropriate coding for ME/CFS.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: No specific diagnostic test for ME/CFS. Laboratory tests are primarily used to rule out other conditions that can cause fatigue.
    *   **Common tests to consider:** Complete Blood Count (CBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (usually normal in ME/CFS, elevated in inflammatory conditions), Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Free T4, Basic metabolic panel (electrolytes, renal function, glucose), Liver function tests, Vitamin D levels, Vitamin B12 levels, Ferritin (iron stores), Urinalysis.
    *   **Other tests as indicated by clinical suspicion:** Lyme serology, HIV test, Hepatitis serology, Autoimmune markers (e.g., ANA) if an autoimmune disease is suspected, Sleep study if a sleep disorder is suspected.

### **18. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms or complications. The most common symptom is heartburn (a burning sensation in the chest, often after eating, that may worsen when lying down or bending over). Other symptoms include regurgitation (bringing up stomach contents into the mouth or throat), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), odynophagia (painful swallowing), chest pain (can mimic cardiac pain), chronic cough, hoarseness, sore throat, and a feeling of a lump in the throat (globus sensation).
-   **Demographics**: Can affect individuals of any age, but more common in adults over 40. Obesity is a major risk factor. Other risk factors include pregnancy, hiatal hernia, smoking, certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics), and certain foods and beverages (e.g., fatty foods, spicy foods, citrus, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol).
-   **Medications**: Management involves lifestyle modifications and medications to reduce stomach acid or improve esophageal motility.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Weight loss, elevating the head of the bed, avoiding trigger foods and beverages, avoiding lying down immediately after eating, avoiding tight clothing.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Antacids (e.g., aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate) provide rapid but short-term relief.
        *   H2 receptor blockers (H2 blockers) (e.g., ranitidine - though largely withdrawn, famotidine, cimetidine) reduce acid production.
        *   Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) (e.g., omeprazole, pantoprazole, esomeprazole) are the most potent acid reducers and are typically the most effective for healing esophagitis and controlling symptoms. Often used as first-line for moderate to severe GERD.
        *   Prokinetics (e.g., metoclopramide - used cautiously due to side effects) can help improve esophageal motility and gastric emptying.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD - can cause epigastric pain that may be relieved or worsened by food, sometimes with heartburn), Esophageal cancer (should be considered in patients with GERD and new or worsening dysphagia, weight loss, or hematemesis), Angina pectoris or other cardiac causes of chest pain (GERD chest pain can mimic cardiac pain, especially if atypical; cardiac evaluation may be necessary), Esophageal spasm, Eosinophilic esophagitis, Gastritis, Gallbladder disease, Hiatal hernia (can be associated with GERD).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing):** Especially if progressive or with solid foods, raises suspicion for esophageal stricture or esophageal cancer.
    *   **Odynophagia (painful swallowing):** Can indicate esophagitis (severe inflammation), infection (e.g., candidiasis), or malignancy.
    *   **Hematemesis (vomiting blood) or Melena (black, tarry stools):** Suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be from severe esophagitis, peptic ulcer, or malignancy.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** A significant red flag for malignancy.
    *   **Iron deficiency anemia:** Can be a sign of chronic blood loss from the GI tract.
    *   **Recurrent vomiting.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis). K21.0 is used if esophagitis is present.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Further investigations are typically reserved for patients with red-flag symptoms, atypical presentations, or those who do not respond to initial therapy.
    *   **H. pylori testing:** While H. pylori is a common cause of peptic ulcers, its role in GERD is less clear, but testing may be done, especially if PUD is in the differential.
    *   **Upper endoscopy (EGD):** Allows direct visualization of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, enabling assessment for esophagitis, strictures, Barrett's esophagus, ulcers, or malignancy. Biopsies can be taken.
    *   **Esophageal manometry:** Measures esophageal muscle function.
    *   **24-hour esophageal pH monitoring or wireless pH monitoring:** Measures the amount of acid refluxing into the esophagus over a period of time, useful in confirming the diagnosis in unclear cases or evaluating response to treatment.
    *   **Cardiac workup:** May be necessary to rule out cardiac causes of chest pain.

### **19. Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)**

-   **Symptoms**: Characterized by a break in the lining of the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The most common symptom is epigastric pain (pain in the upper abdomen). The character of the pain can vary; it may be burning, gnawing, or aching. Duodenal ulcer pain often improves with eating and worsens several hours after a meal, while gastric ulcer pain may be worsened by eating. Other symptoms can include bloating, early satiety (feeling full quickly), nausea, vomiting, and sometimes heartburn. Some ulcers can be asymptomatic, particularly those caused by NSAID use.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age but more common in adults. The two main causes are infection with *Helicobacter pylori* (*H. pylori*) bacteria and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin. Smoking and stress can also contribute.
-   **Medications**: Treatment focuses on eradicating *H. pylori* (if present), reducing stomach acid, and protecting the ulcer lining to promote healing.
    *   **For *H. pylori* infection:** Triple therapy (typically a PPI, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole) or quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth, metronidazole, tetracycline) are commonly used antibiotic regimens for eradication.
    *   **To reduce acid and promote healing:** Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are highly effective and are a cornerstone of PUD treatment. H2 receptor blockers are also used but are generally less potent than PPIs.
    *   **To protect the ulcer lining:** Sucralfate forms a protective barrier over the ulcer.
    *   **If caused by NSAIDs:** Discontinuation of the NSAID is recommended if possible. If NSAIDs are necessary, co-prescription of a PPI or misoprostol can reduce ulcer risk.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: GERD (overlapping symptoms of heartburn and epigastric pain), Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining, causing epigastric pain, nausea, and bloating), Pancreatic cancer (can cause epigastric pain that radiates to the back, often with weight loss and jaundice in later stages), Gallbladder disease (e.g., cholecystitis, biliary colic - pain typically in the right upper quadrant, often triggered by fatty meals), Non-ulcer dyspepsia (functional dyspepsia - persistent indigestion symptoms without evidence of structural disease), Esophageal spasm, Angina pectoris (chest pain can sometimes radiate to the epigastrium).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Hematemesis (vomiting blood) or "coffee-ground" emesis:** Indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
    *   **Melena (black, tarry stools):** Indicates bleeding in the upper GI tract.
    *   **Hematochezia (bright red blood in the stool):** Usually indicates lower GI bleeding, but can occur with massive upper GI bleeding.
    *   **Severe, sudden, sharp abdominal pain that is constant and worsens with movement:** Suggests ulcer perforation, a surgical emergency.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** Raises suspicion for gastric cancer (which can present as an ulcer) or pancreatic cancer.
    *   **Persistent vomiting:** May indicate gastric outlet obstruction due to ulcer swelling or scarring.
    *   **Anemia (iron deficiency) due to chronic blood loss.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: K27.9 (Peptic ulcer, site unspecified, unspecified as acute or chronic, without hemorrhage or perforation). More specific codes exist for gastric or duodenal ulcers, acuity, and presence of hemorrhage or perforation.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   ***H. pylori* testing:** Recommended in all patients with active PUD or a history of PUD. Tests include urea breath test, stool antigen test, or biopsy during endoscopy.
    *   **Upper endoscopy (EGD):** The gold standard for diagnosing PUD, allowing direct visualization of the ulcer, biopsy for *H. pylori* and to rule out malignancy (especially in gastric ulcers), and treatment of bleeding ulcers.
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia due to chronic blood loss.
    *   **Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or Fecal immunochemical test (FIT):** To detect occult blood in the stool.
    *   **Serum gastrin levels:** May be measured if Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (a rare condition causing excessive acid production and refractory ulcers) is suspected.

### **20. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**

-   **Symptoms**: A common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or alternating between the two) without evidence of structural or biochemical abnormalities. Symptoms often include abdominal pain or discomfort that is related to defecation or associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Bloating and abdominal distension are also common. IBS is classified into subtypes based on the predominant bowel habit: IBS-D (diarrhea-predominant), IBS-C (constipation-predominant), and IBS-M (mixed bowel habits).
-   **Demographics**: Typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, with onset usually before age 50. More commonly diagnosed in females than males, with a ratio of approximately 2:1. Stress and psychological factors can exacerbate symptoms.
-   **Medications**: Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms and is often multimodal.
    *   **Dietary modifications:** Identifying and avoiding trigger foods (e.g., high-FODMAP foods, dairy, gluten) can be helpful for some patients. Regular meal times and adequate fluid intake are important.
    *   **Medications for abdominal pain:** Antispasmodics (e.g., dicyclomine, hyoscyamine) can help with abdominal cramps. Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or SSRIs may be effective for pain and overall IBS symptoms, particularly in IBS-D.
    *   **Medications for constipation (IBS-C):** Fiber supplements, osmotic laxatives (e.g., polyethylene glycol), lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide.
    *   **Medications for diarrhea (IBS-D):** Loperamide (an antimotility agent), rifaximin (a non-absorbable antibiotic), eluxadoline.
    *   **Other therapies:** Peppermint oil, probiotics (evidence varies), psychological therapies (e.g., CBT, hypnotherapy).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD - Crohn's disease or Ulcerative colitis; characterized by chronic inflammation of the GI tract, often with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and systemic symptoms), Celiac disease (autoimmune reaction to gluten, causing diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and malabsorption), Microscopic colitis (chronic watery diarrhea), Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO - can cause bloating, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habits), Lactose intolerance, Ovarian cancer (can present with bloating and abdominal discomfort, particularly in older women), Colon cancer (less likely to present solely with IBS-like symptoms, but should be considered, especially with red flags), Thyroid dysfunction, Giardiasis or other parasitic infections, Bile acid malabsorption.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Hematochezia (bright red blood in the stool):** Not a typical symptom of IBS and warrants investigation to rule out IBD, diverticulosis, polyps, or malignancy.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** A significant red flag for IBD, malignancy, or malabsorption.
    *   **Anemia (iron deficiency):** Suggests chronic blood loss, even if not visible.
    *   **Onset of symptoms in older age (e.g., over 50):** While IBS can be diagnosed in older adults, new onset of bowel symptoms in this age group warrants a thorough evaluation to exclude malignancy.
    *   **Nocturnal diarrhea:** Diarrhea that wakes the patient from sleep is generally not a feature of IBS and suggests an organic cause.
    *   **Fever, severe or progressive abdominal pain, or signs of malabsorption.**
    *   **Family history of colon cancer or IBD.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: K58.9 (Irritable bowel syndrome without diarrhea). K58.0 is used for IBS with diarrhea.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: No specific diagnostic test for IBS. Investigations are primarily performed to rule out other conditions.
    *   **Common tests to rule out other conditions:** Complete Blood Count (CBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (usually normal in IBS, elevated in IBD), Celiac serology (e.g., tissue transglutaminase IgA), Stool studies (for infection, occult blood, calprotectin), Thyroid function tests.
    *   **Further investigations as indicated by red flags or clinical suspicion:** Colonoscopy (especially for patients over 50, with red flags, or family history), Upper endoscopy, Imaging studies (e.g., CT scan), hydrogen breath test (for SIBO).

### **21. Allergic Rhinitis**

-   **Symptoms**: An inflammatory condition of the nasal passages triggered by allergens. Symptoms include sneezing (often in paroxysms), rhinorrhea (clear, watery nasal discharge), nasal congestion or stuffiness, and pruritus (itching) of the nose, eyes, throat, or ears. Ocular symptoms like itchy, red, watery eyes are common (allergic conjunctivitis). Symptoms can be seasonal (triggered by pollen) or perennial (triggered by allergens like dust mites, pet dander, mold).
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages, commonly starting in childhood or adolescence. Often associated with a personal or family history of other atopic diseases (asthma, eczema, food allergies). Prevalence is high globally.
-   **Medications**: Management involves allergen avoidance and medications to reduce inflammation and symptoms.
    *   **Allergen Avoidance:** Strategies depend on the specific allergens (e.g., using air filters, washing bedding frequently, avoiding outdoor exposure during high pollen counts).
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Intranasal corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone) are highly effective for controlling nasal symptoms and are often considered first-line for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis.
        *   Oral or intranasal antihistamines (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine - less sedating; diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine - more sedating) help with sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea.
        *   Oral or topical decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline) can help with nasal congestion (topical decongestants should be used short-term to avoid rebound congestion).
        *   Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast) can be effective, particularly for patients with concomitant asthma or if other therapies are insufficient.
        *   Nasal saline irrigation helps clear nasal passages.
    *   **Immunotherapy (Allergy Shots or Sublingual Immunotherapy):** Can be considered for patients with persistent or severe symptoms not controlled by medications, or those who wish to reduce long-term medication use. Involves gradually exposing the individual to increasing amounts of the allergen to build tolerance.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Viral rhinitis (common cold - typically acute onset, often with sore throat, cough, and low-grade fever; symptoms usually resolve within a week or two), Non-allergic rhinitis (symptoms similar to allergic rhinitis but not triggered by allergens, can be vasomotor, irritant-induced, etc.), Sinusitis (can occur as a complication of allergic rhinitis, persistent nasal congestion, facial pain, sometimes fever), Rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound nasal congestion from overuse of topical decongestants), Structural nasal abnormalities (e.g., deviated septum, nasal polyps).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Nasal polyps causing significant obstruction or anosmia (loss of smell):** May require ENT referral for evaluation and management.
    *   **Unilateral nasal symptoms (discharge, obstruction, pain):** While allergic rhinitis is typically bilateral, unilateral symptoms warrant investigation to rule out foreign body (especially in children), tumor, or other structural issues.
    *   **Severe facial pain or swelling, high fever, vision changes:** Suggests complications like acute bacterial sinusitis with potential extension or orbital cellulitis.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of chronic rhinosinusitis:** Nasal congestion, facial pain/pressure, reduced sense of smell lasting for 12 weeks or longer.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J30.9 (Allergic rhinitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history.
    *   **Allergy testing:** Skin prick testing or serum-specific IgE testing can identify the specific allergens triggering symptoms and are helpful in confirming the diagnosis, guiding allergen avoidance, and considering immunotherapy.

### **22. Gastroenteritis**

-   **Symptoms**: Acute inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines, commonly caused by viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections ("stomach bug" or "stomach flu," though not related to influenza). Key symptoms include diarrhea (often watery), vomiting, abdominal cramps and pain, nausea, and sometimes low-grade fever, headache, and myalgias. Symptoms typically have a sudden onset and are often self-limiting.
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages. Viral gastroenteritis is highly contagious and can occur in outbreaks, particularly in closed settings like schools or cruise ships. Rotavirus was a common cause in young children before widespread vaccination. Norovirus is a frequent cause of outbreaks in adults. Bacterial gastroenteritis can be caused by contaminated food or water.
-   **Medications**: Treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on preventing dehydration. Antibiotics are generally not used for viral gastroenteritis and are reserved for specific bacterial infections or parasitic infections.
    *   **Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT):** The cornerstone of management, involving drinking fluids with electrolytes (e.g., oral rehydration solutions) to replace lost fluids and salts. Especially important in children and the elderly who are at higher risk of dehydration.
    *   **Antimotility agents (e.g., loperamide):** Can help reduce diarrhea in adults but should be avoided in cases of suspected bacterial dysentery (bloody diarrhea with fever) as they can prolong the infection. Generally not recommended in young children.
    *   **Antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron):** May be used to help control vomiting, particularly in cases where it interferes with oral rehydration.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Only prescribed for specific bacterial pathogens (e.g., *C. difficile*, severe traveler's diarrhea, giardiasis) identified by stool testing or strongly suspected clinically.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Food poisoning (rapid onset of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after consuming contaminated food, often caused by bacterial toxins), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD - can present with diarrhea and abdominal pain, but typically chronic with other symptoms like bloody stool and weight loss), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS - chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, not typically acute onset with vomiting), Diverticulitis, Appendicitis (can initially present with abdominal pain that may be diffuse before localizing, nausea, and vomiting), Ischemic colitis, Medication side effects.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Signs of severe dehydration:** Sunken eyes, decreased urination, lethargy, dizziness, dry mouth and tongue, rapid heart rate. Requires intravenous fluid rehydration, often in a hospital setting.
    *   **Hematochezia (visible blood in the stool):** Suggests an inflammatory or infectious process that may require specific treatment and investigation (e.g., bacterial dysentery, IBD).
    *   **High fever (e.g., >38.5°C or 101.3°F):** More common in bacterial infections.
    *   **Severe, localized abdominal pain:** May indicate a surgical issue like appendicitis or diverticulitis.
    *   **Persistent vomiting that prevents oral fluid intake.**
    *   **Diarrhea lasting longer than several days (e.g., >7 days):** Warrants investigation for less common causes or complications.
    *   **Symptoms in immunocompromised individuals or those with significant comorbidities:** Higher risk of severe or complicated illness.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: K52.9 (Noninfective gastroenteritis and colitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for infective gastroenteritis if the pathogen is identified (e.g., specific viral or bacterial codes).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Laboratory tests are usually not necessary for mild, self-limiting cases.
    *   **Stool studies:** May be performed in cases of severe illness, bloody diarrhea, high fever, symptoms lasting longer than several days, immunocompromise, or suspected outbreak. Tests include stool culture (for bacterial pathogens like Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli), stool PCR (multiplex panels can detect a variety of viruses, bacteria, and parasites), and *C. difficile* toxin testing (if there is a history of antibiotic use).
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** To assess for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, particularly in severe cases.

---

### **23. Mononucleosis (Infectious Mononucleosis)**

-   **Symptoms**: An infectious disease most commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Often referred to as "the kissing disease" because it is spread through saliva. Symptoms typically include fever, severe sore throat (often with exudates), and swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), particularly in the neck (posterior cervical). Other common symptoms include fatigue, malaise, headache, muscle aches, and sometimes a rash. Splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen) and hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver) can occur. Symptoms can last for several weeks or even months, particularly the fatigue.
-   **Demographics**: Most commonly affects adolescents and young adults. Infection in young children is often asymptomatic or presents as a mild, non-specific illness.
-   **Medications**: Treatment is primarily supportive, as it is a viral infection. Antibiotics are ineffective.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Rest, hydration, and over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) for fever and pain.
    *   **Corticosteroids:** May be used in select cases for complications such as significant airway obstruction due to swollen tonsils or severe thrombocytopenia or anemia.
    *   **Antiviral medications:** While EBV is a virus, antiviral medications are generally not recommended for uncomplicated infectious mononucleosis.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat - bacterial infection with sore throat, fever, and lymphadenopathy, but typically without the prolonged fatigue or splenomegaly of mono), CMV infection (Cytomegalovirus - another virus that can cause a mononucleosis-like illness, particularly in immunocompromised individuals), Toxoplasmosis (parasitic infection that can cause fever and lymphadenopathy), Acute HIV infection (can present with fever, rash, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy), Viral pharyngitis (other viruses causing sore throat), Lymphoma (though less likely with acute onset and typical symptoms).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Significant splenomegaly with left upper quadrant pain:** Indicates a risk of splenic rupture, particularly with trauma or strenuous activity. Patients should avoid contact sports and heavy lifting for several weeks to months until the spleen returns to normal size.
    *   **Airway compromise:** Severe tonsillar enlargement can obstruct the airway, requiring urgent medical intervention and potentially corticosteroids.
    *   **Neurological complications:** Rare but can occur, such as encephalitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome.
    *   **Severe thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or hemolytic anemia:** Can occur in some cases and may require treatment.
    *   **Jaundice or significant right upper quadrant pain:** May indicate significant hepatitis.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: B27.90 (Infectious mononucleosis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for infectious mononucleosis with specific complications (e.g., with hepatitis, with meningitis).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Heterophile antibody test (Monospot test):** A common initial test that detects heterophile antibodies produced during EBV infection. It is relatively specific but may be negative early in the illness, particularly in young children.
    *   **EBV serology:** If the Monospot test is negative or the diagnosis is uncertain, specific EBV antibody tests (e.g., viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM and IgG, EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG) can help confirm the diagnosis and determine the stage of infection.
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential:** May show a characteristic lymphocytosis (increased number of lymphocytes), often with atypical lymphocytes. Mild thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) are also common.

---

### **24. Conjunctivitis**

-   **Symptoms**: Inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids. Commonly known as "pink eye." Symptoms include redness of the conjunctiva, discharge (watery, mucoid, or purulent), itching, burning or gritty sensation in the eye, mild photophobia (sensitivity to light), and sometimes eyelid swelling. Vision is typically normal. Can affect one or both eyes.
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages. Highly contagious viral conjunctivitis is a common cause of outbreaks, especially in schools and crowded settings. Bacterial conjunctivitis is also common, particularly in children. Allergic conjunctivitis is often seen in individuals with other allergies and can be seasonal or perennial.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the cause (viral, bacterial, allergic).
    *   **Viral Conjunctivitis:** Most common cause, often associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Treatment is supportive: artificial tears, cold compresses. Highly contagious - emphasize hygiene (handwashing, avoiding sharing towels).
    *   **Bacterial Conjunctivitis:** More common in children, often with thicker, purulent (pus-like) discharge. Treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointment (e.g., erythromycin, sulfacetamide, fluoroquinolones).
    *   **Allergic Conjunctivitis:** Often bilateral, with prominent itching and watery discharge. Treatment includes identifying and avoiding allergens, artificial tears, topical antihistamines (e.g., olopatadine, azelastine), topical mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromolyn), or topical NSAIDs. Topical corticosteroids may be used for severe cases under ophthalmologist supervision.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Allergic conjunctivitis (prominent itching, often with other allergy symptoms), Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea - usually more severe pain, photophobia, and vision changes), Uveitis (inflammation of the uvea - pain, photophobia, decreased vision, ciliary flush around the iris), Scleritis (inflammation of the sclera - severe pain, intense redness), Acute angle-closure glaucoma (severe eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, vomiting, fixed dilated pupil - a medical emergency), Foreign body in the eye, Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Severe eye pain:** Conjunctivitis is usually associated with discomfort or a gritty sensation, not severe pain. Severe pain suggests involvement of the cornea, iris, or other deeper structures.
    *   **Vision changes (decreased visual acuity, blurred vision):** Conjunctivitis should not significantly affect vision. Vision changes are a red flag for keratitis, uveitis, or other more serious conditions.
    *   **Significant photophobia (severe sensitivity to light):** Can indicate inflammation within the eye (e.g., uveitis) or corneal involvement.
    *   **Ciliary flush:** Redness concentrated in a ring around the iris, suggestive of uveitis or keratitis.
    *   **Corneal opacity or ulceration visible on examination.**
    *   **Pupil abnormalities (size, shape, reactivity):** Can indicate serious ocular or neurological issues.
    *   **Proptosis (protrusion of the eyeball) or limited eye movements:** Suggests orbital involvement.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: H10.9 (Conjunctivitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different types of conjunctivitis (e.g., viral, bacterial, allergic) and laterality (right eye, left eye, bilateral).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Laboratory tests are generally not necessary for typical cases.
    *   **Conjunctival swab for culture and sensitivity:** May be indicated for severe or recurrent bacterial conjunctivitis, in immunocompromised patients, or if there is suspicion of a less common pathogen (e.g., Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae - in which case rapid referral is needed).

---

### **25. Headaches (Tension-Type)**

-   **Symptoms**: The most common type of headache. Typically described as a bilateral, non-pulsatile, mild to moderate pressure or tightness sensation, often described as feeling like a band around the head. Usually does not worsen with physical activity. May be accompanied by tenderness of the scalp, neck, and shoulder muscles. Nausea and vomiting are usually absent, although mild photophobia or phonophobia may occur (but not both as typically seen in migraine). Can be episodic or chronic (occurring frequently).
-   **Demographics**: Very common, affecting a large proportion of the population at some point in their lives. More prevalent in females than males, with onset often in young adulthood (age 30-50 peak). Stress, poor posture, and muscle tension can contribute.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves both acute treatment for individual headaches and preventive treatment for frequent or debilitating headaches.
    *   **Acute Treatment:** Over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen) are often effective. Combination analgesics (e.g., with caffeine) can also be used.
    *   **Preventive Treatment (for chronic or frequent episodic tension-type headaches):** Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) are often considered first-line for prevention. Other options may include other antidepressants or muscle relaxants.
    *   **Non-pharmacological therapies:** Stress management techniques, biofeedback, physical therapy, massage, and acupuncture can be helpful.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Migraine (typically unilateral, pulsating, moderate to severe pain, often with nausea/vomiting and photophobia/phonophobia), Cluster headache (severe, unilateral, orbital or periorbital pain, occurring in clusters, with autonomic symptoms), Secondary headaches (headaches caused by underlying medical conditions).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: It is crucial to differentiate tension-type headaches from more serious secondary causes of headache.
    *   **Thunderclap headache:** Sudden, severe headache reaching maximum intensity within seconds to minutes. **Medical emergency.**
    *   **Headache with focal neurological deficits:** New onset of weakness, numbness, speech difficulties, vision loss, etc. **Requires urgent investigation.**
    *   **Headache with fever, neck stiffness, or rash:** Suggests meningitis or encephalitis.
    *   **Headache that is new or different, especially in a patient with a history of cancer or immunocompromise.**
    *   **Headache that worsens with coughing, straining, or changes in position.**
    *   **Headache with papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve head).**
    *   **New onset headache in a patient over 50 years old, especially if associated with jaw claudication or visual symptoms:** Could indicate giant cell arteritis.
    *   **Headache following head trauma.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: G44.209 (Tension-type headache, unspecified, not intractable). More specific codes exist for episodic or chronic tension-type headaches and intractability.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Neuroimaging (CT or MRI of the head) is generally not needed for typical tension-type headaches but is indicated if any red-flag symptoms are present or if the diagnosis is uncertain.
    *   **May consider:** ESR (if giant cell arteritis is suspected in older patients).

### **26. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

-   **Symptoms**: Characterized by excessive worry and anxiety about various events or activities that is difficult to control and occurs on most days for at least six months. The worry is often accompanied by at least three of the following symptoms: restlessness or feeling on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep). The anxiety and worry cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age, but onset is often in late adolescence or early adulthood (age 30-50 peak). More common in females than males. Family history may increase risk. Stressful life events can trigger or worsen GAD.
-   **Medications**: Treatment often involves a combination of psychotherapy and medications.
    *   **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective form of therapy for GAD, helping individuals identify and challenge anxious thoughts and develop coping strategies.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine) are often considered first-line pharmacological treatment.
        *   Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine) are also effective.
        *   Buspirone is an alternative medication that can be helpful for anxiety symptoms, particularly worry.
        *   Benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, lorazepam) may be used for short-term relief of acute, severe anxiety but are generally avoided for long-term treatment due to the risk of dependence and withdrawal.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Hyperthyroidism (can cause anxiety, restlessness, palpitations), Panic disorder (characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks), Social anxiety disorder (anxiety specifically in social situations), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD - characterized by obsessions and compulsions), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD - anxiety symptoms triggered by a traumatic event), Specific phobias, Medication side effects (e.g., stimulants, corticosteroids), Substance use or withdrawal, Other medical conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, pheochromocytoma).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Suicidal ideation or intent:** While anxiety disorders increase the risk of suicidality, any thoughts of self-harm require immediate assessment and intervention.
    *   **Panic attacks with atypical symptoms (e.g., chest pain radiating to the arm, significant shortness of breath not relieved by hyperventilation):** While panic attacks can mimic medical emergencies, atypical presentations warrant investigation to rule out cardiac or pulmonary causes.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of a medical cause:** New onset anxiety with significant physical symptoms like palpitations, tremors, weight loss (suggesting hyperthyroidism), or episodic symptoms (suggesting pheochromocytoma).
    *   **Psychosis (hallucinations or delusions):** Not typical of GAD and suggests a different psychiatric disorder.
    *   **Significant impairment in functioning that is rapidly worsening.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: F41.1 (Generalized anxiety disorder).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history and mental status examination. Laboratory tests are mainly used to rule out other medical conditions that can mimic anxiety.
    *   **Common tests to consider:** Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) (to rule out hyperthyroidism), Complete Blood Count (CBC), Basic metabolic panel (electrolytes, glucose), Liver function tests.
    *   **Other tests as indicated:** Electrocardiogram (EKG) (if cardiac symptoms are prominent), Toxicology screen (if substance use is suspected), potentially further endocrine testing if a hormonal cause is suspected.

### **27. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)**

-   **Symptoms**: An infection in any part of the urinary system, most commonly the bladder (cystitis). Symptoms typically include dysuria (pain or burning during urination), increased urinary frequency, strong and persistent urge to urinate (urgency), passing small amounts of urine frequently, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and sometimes hematuria (blood in the urine). If the infection ascends to the kidneys (pyelonephritis), symptoms are usually more severe and include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and flank pain (pain in the back or side, typically below the ribs).
-   **Demographics**: Very common, particularly in females due to their shorter urethra (approximately 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime). Risk factors in women include sexual activity, use of certain types of contraception (e.g., diaphragms, spermicides), pregnancy, and menopause. In males, UTIs are less common and often associated with structural abnormalities or prostate issues (e.g., BPH). The elderly and individuals with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or urinary tract abnormalities are also at increased risk.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic and duration of therapy depend on the severity of the infection, the suspected or identified pathogen, local resistance patterns, and patient factors (e.g., allergies, renal function).
    *   **For uncomplicated cystitis:** Short courses of antibiotics are often prescribed (e.g., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fosfomycin).
    *   **For pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs:** Longer courses of antibiotics are needed, often initially with intravenous antibiotics in hospitalized patients, followed by oral therapy. Fluoroquinolones or extended-spectrum cephalosporins may be used.
    *   **Symptomatic relief:** Phenazopyridine can help reduce dysuria (it is a urinary analgesic, not an antibiotic). Adequate hydration is important.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Cystitis (bladder infection), Pyelonephritis (kidney infection), Sexually transmitted infections (STIs - e.g., gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes simplex can cause dysuria), Vaginitis (vaginal inflammation - can cause dysuria and discharge), Urethritis (inflammation of the urethra), Interstitial cystitis (chronic bladder pain syndrome), Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate in men), Epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis in men), Kidney stones, Bladder cancer (less common, but can present with hematuria).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Fever (>38.5°C or 101.3°F) and chills:** Suggests pyelonephritis or systemic infection.
    *   **Flank pain (costovertebral angle tenderness):** Indicates kidney involvement (pyelonephritis).
    *   **Nausea and vomiting:** Common in pyelonephritis.
    *   **Sepsis (signs of systemic infection):** Hypotension, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, altered mental status. **Medical emergency.**
    *   **Symptoms of obstruction:** Inability to urinate, severe pain.
    *   **Hematuria that is persistent or macroscopic (visible blood):** While can occur with UTI, warrants investigation to rule out other causes, especially in older patients or those with risk factors for malignancy or stones.
    *   **UTI symptoms in a male:** Often considered complicated and warrants further investigation to identify the underlying cause (e.g., prostate issues, structural abnormalities).
    *   **UTI in pregnancy:** Requires prompt treatment to prevent complications.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N39.0 (Unspecified urinary tract infection). More specific codes exist for infections of the bladder (N30.-), kidney (N10-N12), etc.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Urinalysis:** A quick test that checks for the presence of white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), bacteria, nitrites (produced by some bacteria), and leukocyte esterase (an enzyme found in white blood cells). Pyuria (WBCs in urine) and bacteriuria are suggestive of UTI.
    *   **Urine culture and sensitivity:** The gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of bacterial UTI, identifying the specific bacteria causing the infection, and determining which antibiotics are effective. Recommended in complicated UTIs, pyelonephritis, recurrent UTIs, UTIs in males, children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients.
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** To assess renal function (creatinine, BUN) and electrolytes, particularly in suspected pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs.
    *   **Blood cultures:** May be done in patients with suspected pyelonephritis or sepsis.
    *   **Imaging (e.g., renal ultrasound, CT scan):** May be indicated in patients with complicated UTIs, recurrent pyelonephritis, or suspicion of obstruction or structural abnormalities.

### **28. Pneumonia**

-   **Symptoms**: An infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and commonly include fever, cough (often producing phlegm or pus), shortness of breath (dyspnea), chest pain that worsens with breathing or coughing (pleuritic pain), fatigue, and sometimes nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In older adults, symptoms may be less typical, presenting with confusion, altered mental status, or lower-than-normal body temperature.
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages, but more common and can be more severe in infants and young children, adults over 65, and individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic medical conditions (e.g., COPD, asthma, diabetes, heart failure). Smoking is a significant risk factor. Can be caused by bacteria (most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia), viruses (e.g., influenza, RSV, COVID-19), or fungi.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the cause of the pneumonia (bacterial, viral, fungal) and the severity.
    *   **Bacterial Pneumonia:** Treated with antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic depends on factors such as whether the pneumonia was acquired in the community or hospital, the patient's age, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns. Common antibiotics include amoxicillin, azithromycin, doxycycline, and fluoroquinolones.
    *   **Viral Pneumonia:** Antibiotics are not effective against viruses. Treatment is usually supportive (rest, fluids, fever reducers). Antiviral medications may be used for specific viral causes (e.g., oseltamivir for influenza pneumonia).
    *   **Fungal Pneumonia:** Treated with antifungal medications.
    *   **Other supportive care:** Supplemental oxygen therapy (if hypoxemic), bronchodilators (if bronchospasm is present), fever reducers/pain relievers.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: COPD exacerbation, Asthma exacerbation, Acute bronchitis, Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung - can cause sudden onset dyspnea and chest pain, sometimes with cough), Heart failure exacerbation (can cause dyspnea and cough, sometimes with wheeze - "cardiac asthma"), Tuberculosis, Lung cancer, Pleural effusion, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Significant dyspnea or respiratory distress:** Rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, use of accessory muscles.
    *   **Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen saturation):** Requires supplemental oxygen.
    *   **High fever or hypothermia (low body temperature):** Can indicate severe infection.
    *   **Hemoptysis (coughing up blood):** While can occur in pneumonia, also a red flag for tuberculosis or lung cancer.
    *   **Chest pain that is severe or persistent.**
    *   **Altered mental status or confusion, especially in older adults.**
    *   **Signs of sepsis:** Hypotension, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing. **Medical emergency.**

### **29. Cellulitis**

-   **Symptoms**: A common bacterial skin infection that affects the deeper layers of the skin (dermis and subcutaneous tissue). Typically presents as an area of skin that is erythematous (red), warm to the touch, swollen, and tender or painful. The redness is often spreading. Fever and chills may also be present, indicating a more widespread infection. The affected skin may appear taut and glossy.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur in individuals of any age. Risk factors include breaks in the skin (cuts, scrapes, insect bites, surgical wounds), chronic skin conditions (e.g., eczema, athlete's foot), lymphedema (swelling due to impaired lymphatic drainage), obesity, diabetes, weakened immune system, and a history of cellulitis. Most commonly caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* or *Staphylococcus aureus*.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic depends on the severity of the infection, the likely causative bacteria, and patient factors.
    *   **For uncomplicated cellulitis:** Oral antibiotics are typically prescribed (e.g., cephalexin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin). Duration is usually 5-10 days.
    *   **For suspected MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant *Staphylococcus aureus*):** Antibiotics effective against MRSA are needed (e.g., TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin).
    *   **For severe cellulitis, rapidly spreading infection, or systemic symptoms (fever, chills):** Intravenous antibiotics may be required, often necessitating hospitalization.
    *   **Supportive care:** Elevation of the affected limb, analgesics for pain.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Erysipelas (a superficial form of cellulitis, typically with a well-demarcated, raised border, often on the face or lower extremities), Necrotizing fasciitis (a severe, rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the deeper tissues, including the fascia, often with severe pain out of proportion to examination findings, bullae, skin discoloration, and crepitus - **medical emergency**), Contact dermatitis (inflammatory reaction to an irritant or allergen, usually intensely itchy, may have vesicles or bullae, typically lacks the warmth, spreading redness, and systemic symptoms of cellulitis), Deep vein thrombosis (DVT - blood clot in a deep vein, causing swelling, pain, and warmth, but typically without the spreading erythema or fever of cellulitis), Abscess (a localized collection of pus, often with a fluctuant center), Insect bites or stings, Gout or pseudogout (can cause localized redness, swelling, and pain around a joint), Osteomyelitis (bone infection).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Rapidly spreading erythema or development of bullae (blisters) or skin necrosis (tissue death).**
    *   **Severe pain out of proportion to the clinical appearance.**
    *   **Crepitus (a crackling sensation under the skin) on palpation:** Suggests gas production by bacteria, a sign of necrotizing fasciitis.
    *   **Systemic toxicity:** High fever, chills, hypotension, rapid heart rate, confusion. **Medical emergency.**
    *   **Lymphangitis (red streaks extending from the area of cellulitis towards the lymph nodes).**

    *   **Failure to improve within 24-48 hours of starting appropriate antibiotics.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: L03.90 (Cellulitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for cellulitis of specific sites (e.g., face, limb).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on physical examination. Laboratory tests may be helpful in more severe cases or to guide treatment.
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** May show an elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis).
    *   **C-Reactive Protein (CRP):** An inflammatory marker that is often elevated in bacterial infections.
    *   **Blood cultures:** Recommended for patients with severe cellulitis, systemic symptoms, or those who are immunocompromised, to detect bacteremia.
    *   **Wound cultures:** If there is an open wound, purulent discharge, or abscess, a culture can help identify the causative organism and determine antibiotic sensitivity.
    *   **Imaging (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan, MRI):** May be needed to rule out deeper infections (e.g., abscess, osteomyelitis, necrotizing fasciitis) or DVT.

### **30. Anemia (Iron Deficiency Anemia)**

-   **Symptoms**: A condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin, leading to reduced oxygen transport. Iron deficiency is the most common cause. Symptoms depend on the severity and how quickly it develops. Common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, pallor (pale skin, conjunctivae, and nail beds), dyspnea (shortness of breath), dizziness or lightheadedness, headache, cold hands and feet, brittle nails, and pica (craving for non-food substances like ice or dirt). Severe anemia can lead to chest pain, palpitations, and exacerbation of underlying cardiovascular disease.
-   **Demographics**: More common in pre-menopausal women due to menstrual blood loss, and during pregnancy due to increased iron requirements. Also common in children and adolescents during periods of rapid growth. Other risk factors include inadequate dietary iron intake, malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, post-gastric surgery), and chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., peptic ulcers, colon polyps or cancer, IBD, diverticulosis) or urinary tract.
-   **Medications**: Treatment focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause of iron deficiency and replenishing iron stores.
    *   **Oral Iron Supplements:** Ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, or ferrous fumarate are commonly used. Treatment typically continues for several months after hemoglobin levels normalize to replenish iron stores. Side effects can include constipation, nausea, and dark stools.
    *   **Intravenous (IV) Iron:** May be necessary for patients who cannot tolerate oral iron, have malabsorption, or require rapid replenishment of iron stores (e.g., severe anemia, chronic kidney disease).
    *   **Dietary modifications:** Encouraging consumption of iron-rich foods (red meat, poultry, fish, beans, leafy greens, fortified cereals) and foods that enhance iron absorption (e.g., vitamin C).
    *   **Treating the underlying cause:** Addressing the source of blood loss or malabsorption is crucial for long-term resolution.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Anemia of chronic disease (common in chronic inflammatory, infectious, or malignant conditions, typically with low serum iron and transferrin saturation but normal or elevated ferritin), Thalassemia (genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin production, often with microcytosis and normal iron studies), Vitamin B12 deficiency or Folate deficiency (macrocytic anemia, often with neurological symptoms in B12 deficiency), Hemolytic anemia (premature destruction of red blood cells), Aplastic anemia (failure of the bone marrow to produce blood cells), Myelodysplastic syndromes, Anemia associated with chronic kidney disease.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Anemia associated with unexplained weight loss, changes in bowel habits, or abdominal pain:** Raises suspicion for gastrointestinal malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease causing chronic blood loss.
    *   **Anemia associated with hematuria:** Warrants investigation for urinary tract causes of bleeding (e.g., stones, malignancy).
    *   **Severe anemia with symptoms of cardiovascular compromise:** Chest pain, severe dyspnea, palpitations.
    *   **Presence of symptoms suggestive of malabsorption:** Chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea (fatty stools).
    *   **Anemia that does not respond to appropriate iron supplementation:** May indicate incorrect diagnosis, ongoing significant blood loss, malabsorption, or non-adherence.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: D50.9 (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified). Specific codes exist for iron deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss or nutritional deficiency.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Shows low hemoglobin and hematocrit. In iron deficiency anemia, red blood cells are typically microcytic (small MCV) and hypochromic (pale MCH, MCHC). Red cell distribution width (RDW) is often elevated.
    *   **Iron studies:**
        *   **Serum ferritin:** The most sensitive and specific test for iron deficiency, reflecting total body iron stores. Typically low in iron deficiency. Note: Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be falsely normal or elevated in the presence of inflammation or infection, even with low iron stores.
        *   **Serum iron:** Measures the amount of iron in the blood. Usually low in iron deficiency.
        *   **Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC):** Measures the capacity of transferrin to bind iron. Typically elevated in iron deficiency as the body tries to maximize iron binding.
        *   **Transferrin saturation:** Calculated as (Serum Iron / TIBC) x 100. Represents the percentage of transferrin that is saturated with iron. Typically low in iron deficiency.
    *   **Peripheral blood smear:** Can show microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells.
    *   **Further investigations to find the cause of iron deficiency (especially in men and postmenopausal women or with red flags):** Fecal occult blood test or FIT, Upper endoscopy, Colonoscopy, Celiac serology, Pelvic ultrasound (for excessive menstrual bleeding).

### **31. Acute Otitis Media (AOM)**

-   **Symptoms**: An acute infection of the middle ear, located behind the eardrum. Most common in children. Symptoms include ear pain (otalgia), often sudden in onset and worse when lying down. Infants and young children may be irritable, have difficulty sleeping, pull at their ear, and have decreased appetite or fever. Older children and adults may report ear pain, muffled hearing, a feeling of fullness in the ear, and sometimes fever, headache, or dizziness. There may be associated symptoms of a preceding upper respiratory tract infection.
-   **Demographics**: Very common in young children (peak incidence between 6 and 18 months). Risk factors include attending daycare, exposure to cigarette smoke, bottle feeding (especially lying down), lack of breastfeeding, seasonal allergies, and a family history of ear infections. Less common in adults. Most often caused by bacteria (e.g., *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Moraxella catarrhalis*) or viruses.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves pain management and sometimes antibiotics. Antibiotic use should be judicious, especially in children, due to concerns about antibiotic resistance.
    *   **Pain Management:** Acetaminophen or ibuprofen are important for relieving ear pain. Topical ear drops (e.g., containing benzocaine) can also help with pain if the eardrum is intact.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Indications for antibiotics vary based on age and severity. In children 6 months and older with mild symptoms, a period of watchful waiting (48-72 hours) may be appropriate as AOM can resolve spontaneously. Antibiotics are generally recommended for children under 24 months with bilateral AOM, children of any age with severe symptoms (moderate to severe ear pain, fever ≥39°C), or children with otorrhea (drainage from the ear). Amoxicillin is often the first-line antibiotic. Amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalosporins may be used if initial treatment fails or if there is a high risk of resistant bacteria.
    *   **Decongestants and antihistamines:** Generally not effective for AOM.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Otitis externa ("swimmer's ear" - infection of the ear canal, pain is worse with movement of the tragus or pinna, ear canal may be swollen and have discharge), Serous otitis media (OME - fluid in the middle ear without signs of acute infection, causes muffled hearing but usually no pain or fever), Mastoiditis (infection of the mastoid bone behind the ear - tenderness, swelling, and redness over the mastoid, often with fever and severe pain - **medical emergency**), Strep throat (can cause referred ear pain), Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction (can cause ear pain), Dental pain, Foreign body in the ear canal.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Tenderness, swelling, or redness over the mastoid bone behind the ear:** Strong suspicion for mastoiditis, a serious complication requiring urgent evaluation and often IV antibiotics or surgery.
    *   **Facial weakness or asymmetry:** Can indicate facial nerve paralysis due to severe middle ear infection.
    *   **Vertigo or dizziness with AOM:** May indicate labyrinthitis, a complication involving the inner ear.
    *   **Signs of meningitis (fever, headache, neck stiffness):** Rare complication of AOM.
    *   **Significant hearing loss persisting after the acute infection.**
    *   **Recurrent or persistent AOM:** May require evaluation for underlying issues or consideration of tympanostomy tubes.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: H66.90 (Otitis media, unspecified, unspecified ear). More specific codes exist for acute suppurative otitis media, recurrent AOM, laterality, and with or without spontaneous rupture of the eardrum.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on otoscopic examination (visualizing the eardrum).
    *   **Pneumatic otoscopy or tympanometry:** Can help assess the mobility of the eardrum and the presence of middle ear effusion.
    *   **Laboratory tests are generally not needed for uncomplicated AOM.** If systemic symptoms are severe, a CBC might be done, but it's not routine.

### **32. Acute Bronchitis**

-   **Symptoms**: An acute inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the lungs. Most commonly caused by viruses, often following a common cold or flu. The hallmark symptom is a cough, which may initially be dry but often becomes productive of mucus (sputum) that can be clear, white, yellow, or green. Other symptoms can include chest soreness or discomfort, mild shortness of breath, wheezing, low-grade fever, chills, and fatigue. Symptoms usually last for a few weeks, but the cough can linger for several weeks after other symptoms have resolved.
-   **Demographics**: Very common, affecting individuals of all ages, particularly during the colder months when respiratory viruses are prevalent. More common in smokers and individuals exposed to air pollution or irritants.
-   **Medications**: Treatment is primarily supportive, as the vast majority of cases are viral. Antibiotics are generally not effective and should be avoided unless there is strong suspicion of a bacterial infection (rare) or underlying lung disease.
    *   **Symptomatic Relief:** Rest, hydration. Over-the-counter cough suppressants (for bothersome dry cough) or expectorants (for productive cough) may be used, although evidence of efficacy is limited. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain.
    *   **Bronchodilators:** May be prescribed if wheezing is present, but their benefit in acute bronchitis without underlying lung disease is limited.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Reserved for specific situations, such as suspected pertussis or in patients with significant underlying cardiopulmonary disease.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Pneumonia (more severe infection of the lung tissue, usually with higher fever, significant dyspnea, and abnormal chest X-ray), COPD exacerbation (acute worsening of symptoms in a patient with chronic COPD), Asthma exacerbation (acute worsening of symptoms in a patient with asthma), Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI - symptoms typically localized to the nose, throat, sinuses before progressing to cough), Pertussis ("whooping cough" - bacterial infection causing severe coughing fits, can occur despite vaccination), Postnasal drip, GERD (can cause chronic cough), Environmental irritant exposure.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **High fever (>38.5°C or 101.3°F):** More suggestive of pneumonia or influenza.
    *   **Significant shortness of breath or difficulty breathing:** Raises suspicion for pneumonia or exacerbation of underlying lung disease.
    *   **Hemoptysis (coughing up blood):** While streaks of blood can sometimes be seen in sputum with severe coughing, gross hemoptysis is a red flag for more serious conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer.
    *   **Chest pain that is pleuritic (worse with breathing):** More common in pneumonia or pleural inflammation.
    *   **Signs of consolidation or significant abnormalities on lung examination (e.g., egophony, crackles):** Suggests pneumonia.
    *   **Symptoms lasting longer than 3-4 weeks:** Warrants investigation for other causes of chronic cough.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J20.9 (Acute bronchitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist if a specific pathogen is identified.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history and physical examination. Laboratory tests and chest X-rays are usually not necessary for typical acute bronchitis.
    *   **Chest X-ray:** Indicated if red-flag symptoms are present (high fever, significant dyspnea, hypoxemia, abnormal lung exam) or to rule out pneumonia, especially in older adults, smokers, or those with comorbidities.
    *   **Influenza or COVID-19 testing:** If suspected based on symptoms and epidemiology.
    *   **Sputum culture:** Rarely needed, only if there is purulent sputum and suspicion of a bacterial infection, particularly in patients with underlying lung disease.

### **33. Sinusitis (Acute)**

-   **Symptoms**: An inflammation of the lining of the paranasal sinuses, typically caused by viral or bacterial infection. Often follows an upper respiratory tract infection or allergic rhinitis. Symptoms include nasal congestion and obstruction, purulent nasal discharge (often colored yellow or green), facial pain or pressure (worse when bending forward), headache (often over the affected sinus), reduced sense of smell (hyposmia or anosmia), fever, cough (often worse at night), fatigue, and sometimes ear fullness or pain. Symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis typically persist longer than 10 days or worsen after initial improvement (Worsening after Improvement - "double sickening").
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages. Risk factors include allergic rhinitis, structural abnormalities of the nasal passages or sinuses (e.g., deviated septum, nasal polyps), smoking, weakened immune system, and recent upper respiratory tract infection.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on whether the cause is viral or bacterial and the severity. Most cases are viral and self-limiting.
    *   **Symptomatic Relief (for viral or bacterial sinusitis):** Nasal saline irrigation, intranasal corticosteroids (help reduce inflammation), oral or topical decongestants (use topical decongestants short-term), analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) for pain and fever.
    *   **Antibiotics (for acute bacterial sinusitis):** Indicated if symptoms are severe (high fever, severe facial pain) or if symptoms of presumed viral sinusitis persist for more than 10 days without improvement or worsen after initial improvement. Amoxicillin is often first-line. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, doxycycline, or respiratory fluoroquinolones may be used for more severe cases, treatment failures, or in patients with antibiotic allergies.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Viral rhinitis (common cold - symptoms are generally less severe and typically resolve within 7-10 days), Allergic rhinitis, Structural nasal abnormalities, Dental infection (can cause facial pain that mimics sinusitis), Trigeminal neuralgia, Migraine or tension headache.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Severe headache and facial pain with high fever:** While can occur in bacterial sinusitis, also consider more serious infections.
    *   **Vision changes (double vision, decreased vision) or periorbital swelling (swelling around the eye):** Suggests potential spread of infection to the orbit or central nervous system. **Medical emergency.**
    *   **Forehead swelling or redness:** Can indicate involvement of the frontal sinus and potential intracranial spread.
    *   **Stiff neck or altered mental status:** Raises suspicion for meningitis.
    *   **Symptoms in an immunocompromised individual:** Higher risk of complications.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J01.90 (Acute sinusitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for acute sinusitis of specific sinuses (e.g., maxillary, frontal) and for chronic sinusitis (J32.-).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Imaging (CT scan of the sinuses) is generally not needed for typical acute sinusitis and is reserved for cases with red-flag symptoms, recurrent or chronic sinusitis, or before sinus surgery.
    *   **Microbiological studies (e.g., nasal endoscopy with culture of sinus aspirate):** Rarely needed in primary care for acute sinusitis, usually reserved for refractory cases or immunocompromised patients.

### **34. Non-Specific Back Pain**

-   **Symptoms**: Pain and discomfort in the lumbar spine region that is not attributable to a specific, identifiable pathology (like a herniated disc, fracture, infection, or tumor). It is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out specific causes. Symptoms include pain, aching, or stiffness in the lower back, which may radiate into the buttocks or thighs (but typically not below the knee with significant numbness, tingling, or weakness - these suggest nerve root involvement). Pain is often exacerbated by movement or prolonged sitting/standing and may improve with rest. Muscle spasm is common.
-   **Demographics**: Extremely common, affecting a majority of adults at some point in their lives. Can occur at any age but incidence increases with age, peaking in middle age. Risk factors include sedentary lifestyle, obesity, poor posture, lifting heavy objects incorrectly, smoking, and psychological stress.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on pain relief, improving function, and patient education.
    *   **Analgesics:** Acetaminophen or NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) are often first-line for pain relief. Muscle relaxants (e.g., cyclobenzaprine) may be used for short periods for muscle spasm.
    *   **Opioids:** Generally avoided for chronic non-specific back pain due to risks, used only for severe acute pain when other measures are insufficient and for short durations.
    *   **Other medications:** Duloxetine (an SNRI) may be used for chronic low back pain.
    *   **Non-pharmacological therapies:** Exercise (staying active, strengthening exercises, stretching), physical therapy, heat or cold therapy, massage, acupuncture, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness. Patient education and reassurance are important.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Specific causes of back pain must be considered and ruled out, as they may require different management. These include: Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy (sciatica - pain radiating down the leg, often with numbness, tingling, or weakness in a dermatomal/myotomal distribution), Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal, causing leg pain, numbness, or weakness with walking that improves with sitting or leaning forward), Vertebral fracture (especially in patients with osteoporosis or trauma), Spondylolisthesis (slipping of one vertebra over another), Ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies (inflammatory back pain, typically worse in the morning and improves with activity), Infection (e.g., osteomyelitis, discitis, epidural abscess - often with fever, severe localized pain, and elevated inflammatory markers), Malignancy (primary or metastatic cancer to the spine - often with progressive, constant pain that is worse at night, constitutional symptoms), Kidney stones or infection (can cause flank pain radiating to the back), Abdominal aortic aneurysm, Pancreatitis.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: ("Cauda Equina" and "Spinal Cord Compression" are critical red flags)
    *   **Cauda Equina Syndrome:** A surgical emergency. Symptoms include severe low back pain, saddle anesthesia (numbness in the groin and inner thighs), bowel or bladder dysfunction (incontinence or retention), and bilateral lower extremity weakness or sensory deficits.
    *   **Spinal Cord Compression:** Neurological deficits such as progressive weakness or numbness, gait instability, hyperreflexia, or positive Babinski sign.
    *   **Fever or chills with back pain:** Suggests infection (e.g., osteomyelitis, epidural abscess).
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** Raises suspicion for malignancy or chronic infection.
    *   **History of cancer:** Back pain in a patient with a history of cancer should be considered metastatic disease until proven otherwise.
    *   **Immunocompromised state or recent infection:** Increased risk of infectious causes of back pain.
    *   **Back pain following significant trauma.**
    *   **Progressive neurological deficits.**
    *   **Pain that is constant, severe, and worse at night or with rest:** Can be suggestive of inflammatory conditions, infection, or malignancy.
    *   **New onset back pain in a patient over 50 or under 20.**
    *   **Intravenous drug use or recent spinal procedure:** Risk factors for spinal infection.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: M54.5 (Low back pain). More specific codes exist for other types of back pain and regions of the spine.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Generally not necessary for acute, uncomplicated non-specific back pain. Investigations are indicated if red-flag symptoms are present or if symptoms are chronic or not improving.
    *   **Imaging (X-rays, MRI, CT scan):** Not recommended for routine acute low back pain in the absence of red flags. X-rays may be considered if fracture is suspected (e.g., trauma, osteoporosis). MRI is the preferred imaging for evaluating the spinal cord, nerve roots, discs, and ruling out infection or malignancy, indicated for neurological deficits, suspicion of infection or malignancy, or persistent severe pain unresponsive to conservative treatment. CT scan can be useful for visualizing bony structures and fractures.
    *   **Laboratory tests:** Complete Blood Count (CBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (if infection or inflammatory condition is suspected).

### **35. Osteoporosis**

-   **Symptoms**: A disease characterized by decreased bone density and deterioration of bone tissue, leading to increased fragility and risk of fractures. Often called a "silent disease" because there are typically no symptoms until a fracture occurs. Common osteoporotic fractures occur in the hip, spine (vertebral compression fractures), and wrist. Symptoms related to vertebral compression fractures can include acute or chronic back pain, loss of height over time, and development of a stooped posture (kyphosis).
-   **Demographics**: Very common, particularly in postmenopausal women due to decreased estrogen levels, which play a crucial role in maintaining bone density. Also affects men, though generally later in life. Risk factors include advanced age, female sex, Caucasian or Asian ethnicity, family history of osteoporosis or fractures, low body weight, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, certain medical conditions (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease), and certain medications (e.g., long-term corticosteroids, some anticonvulsants, certain cancer treatments).
-   **Medications**: Treatment focuses on preventing fractures by increasing bone density and reducing bone loss. Lifestyle modifications are also crucial.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (through diet and/or supplements), regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercise, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, fall prevention strategies.
    *   **Pharmacological Therapy:**
        *   **Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, ibandronate):** The most commonly prescribed medications, slowing bone resorption. Can be taken orally daily, weekly, or monthly, or intravenously yearly or quarterly.
        *   **Denosumab:** A monoclonal antibody administered by subcutaneous injection every 6 months, also inhibits bone resorption.
        *   **Teriparatide and Abaloparatide:** Parathyroid hormone analogs administered by daily injection, stimulate bone formation (anabolic agents). Typically used for severe osteoporosis or when other treatments fail.
        *   **Raloxifene:** A selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that can help prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. Also reduces the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
        *   Calcitonin (less commonly used, primarily for pain relief from vertebral fractures).
        *   Romosozumab (a newer anabolic agent).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Osteomalacia (softening of bones due to severe vitamin D or phosphate deficiency, can cause bone pain and weakness), Multiple myeloma (a type of blood cancer that affects plasma cells and can cause bone lesions and pain), Metastatic cancer to the bone, Other metabolic bone diseases (e.g., Paget's disease of bone).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Acute, severe back pain occurring suddenly, especially after a minor fall or even spontaneously:** Suggests a vertebral compression fracture. If associated with neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, bowel/bladder changes), it's a surgical emergency (spinal cord compression or cauda equina).
    *   **Fracture occurring with minimal trauma (fragility fracture):** A hallmark of osteoporosis and warrants evaluation for osteoporosis.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss or other constitutional symptoms in a patient with bone pain:** Raises suspicion for malignancy or infection.
    *   **Bone pain localized to a specific area without clear trauma:** Could indicate stress fracture, infection, or tumor.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: M81.9 (Osteoporosis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for age-related osteoporosis, postmenopausal osteoporosis, and osteoporosis with current pathological fracture.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily diagnosed using bone density measurement. Laboratory tests are often used to rule out secondary causes of osteoporosis or other bone diseases.
    *   **Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA scan):** The gold standard for measuring bone mineral density (BMD), typically performed at the hip and spine. Provides a T-score (comparison to young adult peak bone density) and a Z-score (comparison to age-matched peers).
    *   **Laboratory tests to consider:** Serum calcium, Phosphate, Alkaline phosphatase, Vitamin D levels (25-hydroxyvitamin D), Parathyroid hormone (PTH), Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Serum protein electrophoresis and urine protein electrophoresis (if multiple myeloma is suspected), Celiac serology.

### **36. Hyperlipidemia**

-   **Symptoms**: A condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids (fats) in the blood, including cholesterol (LDL "bad" cholesterol, HDL "good" cholesterol, total cholesterol) and triglycerides. Hyperlipidemia is often asymptomatic and is typically detected through routine blood tests. In severe cases, it can cause xanthomas (fatty deposits under the skin, often on tendons or eyelids) or arcus senilis (a white or gray ring around the cornea, can be normal with age but may indicate hyperlipidemia in younger individuals). However, the primary concern of hyperlipidemia is its role as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease).
-   **Demographics**: Prevalence increases with age, often detected in adults over 40. Associated with metabolic syndrome, which includes abdominal obesity, hypertension, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and impaired fasting glucose. Risk factors include genetics (familial hypercholesterolemia), unhealthy diet (high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol), lack of physical activity, obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, certain autoimmune diseases), and certain medications.
-   **Medications**: Treatment focuses on lowering elevated lipid levels to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Lifestyle modifications are fundamental.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Heart-healthy diet (low in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars; high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats), regular physical activity, weight loss (if overweight or obese), smoking cessation, limiting alcohol intake.
    *   **Pharmacological Therapy:**
        *   **Statins (e.g., atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin):** The most effective medications for lowering LDL cholesterol and are considered first-line for most patients requiring lipid-lowering therapy. They also have anti-inflammatory effects.
        *   **Ezetimibe:** Inhibits cholesterol absorption in the small intestine, often used in combination with statins or as monotherapy for patients intolerant to statins.
        *   **PCSK9 inhibitors (e.g., evolocumab, alirocumab):** Injectable medications that significantly lower LDL cholesterol, used for patients with very high LDL (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia) or those who do not achieve goal with statins and ezetimibe.
        *   **Fibrates (e.g., fenofibrate, gemfibrozil):** Primarily used to lower triglycerides and raise HDL cholesterol, can be used for severe hypertriglyceridemia or in combination with statins in select cases.
        *   **Niacin (Nicotinic acid):** Can lower LDL and triglycerides and raise HDL, but often limited by flushing and other side effects.
        *   **Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil):** Can lower very high triglyceride levels.
        *   Bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Familial hypercholesterolemia (a genetic disorder causing very high LDL cholesterol levels from a young age), Secondary hyperlipidemia due to other medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, cholestatic liver disease), Secondary hyperlipidemia due to medications (e.g., certain diuretics, beta-blockers, corticosteroids, protease inhibitors).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Hyperlipidemia itself is often asymptomatic, so red flags are typically related to the complications of atherosclerosis.
    *   **Chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, pain radiating to the arm or jaw:** Symptoms of coronary artery disease.
    *   **Sudden onset of neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, vision changes):** Symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
    *   **Leg pain with walking that improves with rest (claudication):** Symptoms of peripheral artery disease.
    *   **Severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever:** In severe hypertriglyceridemia, can indicate pancreatitis.
    *   **Xanthomas or arcus senilis in a young individual:** Suggests familial hypercholesterolemia.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified). More specific codes exist for pure hypercholesterolemia, pure hypertriglyceridemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, and familial hypercholesterolemia.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Lipid panel:** Measured after a 9-12 hour fast. Includes total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.
    *   **Fasting glucose or HbA1c:** To screen for diabetes, a common comorbidity and risk factor.
    *   **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH):** To rule out hypothyroidism as a cause of secondary hyperlipidemia.
    *   **Renal and liver function tests:** To assess for secondary causes and for monitoring when initiating certain lipid-lowering medications (e.g., statins can cause liver enzyme elevations).
    *   **Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)):** May be measured in select individuals with a strong family history of premature cardiovascular disease or very high cholesterol despite treatment.

### **37. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**

-   **Symptoms**: A progressive loss of kidney function over time. Often asymptomatic in the early stages. As kidney function declines, symptoms can develop due to the buildup of waste products and fluid imbalances. Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, swelling in the legs and ankles (edema), puffiness around the eyes, changes in urination (more frequent, especially at night, or less frequent), muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, persistent itching, difficulty concentrating, and high blood pressure.
-   **Demographics**: Common, particularly in individuals with diabetes (the leading cause of CKD), hypertension (the second leading cause), cardiovascular disease, and a family history of kidney disease. Also more common in older adults and certain racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Black, Hispanic, Indigenous populations). Other causes include glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and prolonged use of certain medications.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on slowing the progression of kidney disease, managing symptoms, and preventing complications.
    *   **Managing underlying conditions:** Strict control of blood glucose (for diabetes) and blood pressure (using medications like ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which are often kidney-protective).
    *   **Medications to manage complications:** Diuretics (for fluid overload), Phosphate binders (to lower elevated phosphate levels), Vitamin D supplements (to manage calcium and bone health), Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (for anemia due to decreased erythropoietin production), Sodium bicarbonate (for metabolic acidosis).
    *   **Dietary modifications:** Restriction of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and protein may be necessary depending on the stage of CKD.
    *   **Renal Replacement Therapy:** Dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or kidney transplantation are necessary when kidney function is severely impaired (end-stage renal disease).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Acute kidney injury (AKI - sudden onset loss of kidney function, often reversible, can be caused by dehydration, medications, infection, obstruction), Glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney filters, can be acute or chronic), Polycystic kidney disease (genetic disorder causing cysts in the kidneys), Urinary tract obstruction (e.g., kidney stones, enlarged prostate, tumors), Interstitial nephritis, renovascular disease.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Acute worsening of kidney function:** Can be due to superimposed AKI, obstruction, or rapid progression of CKD.
    *   **Symptoms of uremia:** Severe fatigue, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, confusion, muscle twitching, pericarditis. Indicates significant accumulation of waste products and often requires urgent dialysis.
    *   **Significant edema or fluid overload that is difficult to manage.**
    *   **Severe hypertension that is difficult to control.**
    *   **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) causing cardiac arrhythmias.**
    *   **Hematuria or flank pain:** While can be associated with some kidney conditions, also raises suspicion for malignancy or stones.
    *   **Symptoms in a patient with a known kidney transplant:** Requires urgent evaluation.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N18.9 (Chronic kidney disease, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different stages of CKD (N18.1 to N18.5) and for end-stage renal disease (N18.6).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Serum creatinine and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR):** Key tests to assess kidney function. eGFR is calculated from serum creatinine, age, sex, and race (although race is being phased out of many calculations). A persistently low eGFR indicates CKD.
    *   **Urinalysis and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) or proteinuria:** To detect protein or albumin in the urine, a marker of kidney damage and progression.
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** To assess electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus), BUN, and glucose.
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia, which is common in CKD.
    *   **Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Vitamin D levels:** To assess for mineral and bone disorder associated with CKD.
    *   **Renal ultrasound:** Imaging study to assess kidney size, look for structural abnormalities, obstruction, or cysts.
    *   **Kidney biopsy:** May be performed in select cases to determine the cause of kidney disease.

### **38. Gout**

-   **Symptoms**: A type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and tissues. Characterized by acute attacks of severe pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in a single joint, most commonly the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe ("podagra"). Attacks often begin suddenly, frequently at night, and can be excruciatingly painful. Other joints commonly affected include the ankle, knee, wrist, and elbow. Between acute attacks, individuals are typically asymptomatic (intercritical gout). Chronic gout can lead to joint damage and the formation of tophi (urate crystal deposits under the skin).
-   **Demographics**: More common in males than females, particularly in middle-aged and older men. In women, incidence increases after menopause. Risk factors include hyperuricemia (high blood uric acid levels), obesity, high intake of purine-rich foods (red meat, seafood), excessive alcohol consumption (especially beer and spirits), sugary drinks (high fructose corn syrup), certain medications (e.g., thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, aspirin at low doses), kidney disease, and certain medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome).
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves managing acute attacks and preventing future attacks by lowering uric acid levels.
    *   **For acute attacks:** NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin, naproxen, ibuprofen) are often first-line if not contraindicated. Colchicine is another effective option, particularly when started early in an attack. Corticosteroids (oral, injected into the joint, or IV) can be used for severe attacks or when NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated.
    *   **For prevention of future attacks (urate-lowering therapy):** Indicated for patients with frequent attacks, tophi, chronic gouty arthritis, or kidney damage due to urate crystals.
        *   Allopurinol is the most commonly used xanthine oxidase inhibitor, reducing uric acid production. Febuxostat is another xanthine oxidase inhibitor.
        *   Uricosuric agents (e.g., probenecid) increase uric acid excretion (less commonly used).
        *   Pegloticase is an enzyme that metabolizes uric acid, used for severe, refractory gout.
    *   **Prophylaxis during initiation of urate-lowering therapy:** Colchicine or low-dose NSAIDs are often prescribed for the first few months when starting urate-lowering therapy to prevent triggering acute attacks.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Septic arthritis (bacterial infection of a joint - also presents with acute, hot, swollen joint, often with fever and systemic toxicity; **medical emergency**), Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease - similar presentation to gout but caused by different crystals), Reactive arthritis, Cellulitis, Trauma, Bursitis.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Fever or systemic toxicity (chills, malaise) accompanying an acutely inflamed joint:** Strongly suggests septic arthritis, which requires urgent aspiration of the joint and often IV antibiotics.
    *   **Severe, rapidly worsening pain, swelling, and redness in a joint.**
    *   **Signs of infection spreading from the joint.**
    *   **Atypical joint involvement (e.g., spine, small joints of the hands without a history of gout).**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: M10.9 (Gout, unspecified). More specific codes exist for idiopathic gout, lead-induced gout, gout with tophi, gouty arthritis, and gout with kidney involvement.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Synovial fluid analysis:** The definitive test for diagnosing gout. Fluid is aspirated from the affected joint and examined under polarized microscopy for the presence of negatively birefringent, needle-shaped monosodium urate crystals. Cell count and Gram stain/culture are also performed to rule out septic arthritis.
    *   **Serum uric acid level:** Typically elevated in patients with gout, but a normal level during an acute attack does not rule out the diagnosis. Uric acid levels are helpful for monitoring the effectiveness of urate-lowering therapy.
    *   **Kidney function tests (creatinine, BUN):** To assess kidney function, as kidney disease can contribute to hyperuricemia, and gout can affect the kidneys.

---

### **39. Influenza**

-   **Symptoms**: An acute viral respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. More severe than the common cold, with symptoms typically having a sudden onset. Common symptoms include fever or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, muscle or body aches (myalgias), headache, and fatigue. Vomiting and diarrhea can occur, particularly in children. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and can lead to serious complications.
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages. Incidence peaks during the annual influenza season (typically fall and winter in the Northern Hemisphere). Certain populations are at higher risk of complications, including young children, adults over 65, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic medical conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune system). Spread primarily through respiratory droplets.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves supportive care and sometimes antiviral medications. Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Rest, hydration, over-the-counter analgesics and fever reducers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen).
    *   **Antiviral Medications (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, baloxavir):** Can be used to treat influenza, particularly in individuals who are hospitalized, have severe illness, or are at high risk of complications. Most effective when started within 48 hours of symptom onset, but can still offer some benefit later in the illness in certain patients. Antivirals can shorten the duration of illness and reduce the risk of complications.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Not effective against influenza virus and should only be used if a bacterial co-infection (e.g., bacterial pneumonia) is suspected.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Common cold (URTI - typically milder symptoms, less fever and body aches, more nasal symptoms), Other viral respiratory infections (e.g., RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus, COVID-19), Streptococcal pharyngitis, Mononucleosis, Pneumonia.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.**
    *   **Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen.**
    *   **Sudden dizziness or confusion.**
    *   **Severe or persistent vomiting.**
    *   **Flu-like symptoms that improve but then return with fever and worse cough.**
    *   **High fever that is not responding to fever reducers.**
    *   **Signs of dehydration.**
    *   **Worsening of underlying chronic medical conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD, diabetes).**
    *   **Symptoms in infants:** Bluish skin color, not interacting, not drinking enough fluids, fever with a rash.
    *   **Symptoms in children:** Fast breathing or trouble breathing, bluish skin color, not drinking enough fluids, not waking up or interacting, being so irritable that the child does not want to be held, flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough, fever with a rash.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J11.1 (Influenza with other respiratory manifestations, virus not identified). Specific codes exist if the influenza virus is identified (e.g., J10.-) or if there are specific complications (e.g., pneumonia - J10.0, J11.0).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms and local epidemiology during influenza season.
    *   **Rapid influenza diagnostic tests or rapid molecular assays:** Can detect the presence of influenza virus in a nasopharyngeal swab within 15-30 minutes. Sensitivity and specificity vary.
    *   **RT-PCR influenza assays:** More accurate than rapid tests but take longer to process.
    *   **Chest X-ray:** If pneumonia is suspected.
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** If dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities are a concern.
    *   **CBC:** May show leukopenia (low white blood cell count).

### **40. Vitamin D Deficiency**

-   **Symptoms**: Insufficient levels of vitamin D in the body, which is essential for calcium and phosphate absorption and bone health, as well as playing roles in immune function and cell growth. Mild deficiency is often asymptomatic. More severe deficiency can lead to bone pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, and increased risk of fractures. In children, severe deficiency causes rickets (softening and weakening of bones, leading to skeletal deformities). In adults, it causes osteomalacia (softening of bones, leading to bone pain and muscle weakness). Emerging research suggests links between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of certain chronic diseases, but these associations are still being studied.
-   **Demographics**: Very common globally. Risk factors include limited sun exposure (e.g., living at higher latitudes, using sunscreen, spending limited time outdoors, darker skin pigmentation), inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D (found in fatty fish, fortified foods), malabsorption disorders (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn's disease, gastric bypass surgery), obesity (vitamin D is sequestered in fat tissue), chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and certain medications. Breastfed infants who do not receive supplementation are also at risk.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves vitamin D supplementation.
    *   **Vitamin D Supplements:** Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) or Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Cholecalciferol is generally preferred as it is more potent and has a longer half-life. Dosing depends on the severity of the deficiency and patient factors. Loading doses may be used for severe deficiency. Maintenance doses are then prescribed.
    *   **Calcium Supplementation:** May be needed in addition to vitamin D, particularly if dietary calcium intake is inadequate.
    *   **Addressing Underlying Cause:** Treating malabsorption disorders or adjusting medications contributing to deficiency.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Osteomalacia (severe vitamin D deficiency causing bone softening), Osteoporosis (reduced bone density, increased fracture risk), Fibromyalgia (widespread musculoskeletal pain), Chronic fatigue syndrome, Hypocalcemia or hypophosphatemia due to other causes, Other causes of bone pain (e.g., fractures, malignancy, infection).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Symptoms of severe hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) due to severe vitamin D deficiency:** Muscle cramps, tingling in hands and feet, tetany, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias. Requires urgent management of calcium and vitamin D levels.
    *   **Severe bone pain or fractures occurring with minimal trauma:** Suggests osteomalacia or osteoporosis.
    *   **Skeletal deformities in children (rickets).**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E55.9 (Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified). Specific codes exist for rickets (E55.0) and osteomalacia (M83.-).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level:** The best indicator of overall vitamin D status. Levels < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) are generally considered deficient, 20-30 ng/mL (50-75 nmol/L) insufficient, and > 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) sufficient (optimal levels are debated, but often targeted > 30).
    *   **Serum calcium and phosphate levels:** To assess for abnormalities related to vitamin D metabolism.
    *   **Alkaline phosphatase:** May be elevated in severe deficiency due to increased bone turnover.
    *   **Parathyroid hormone (PTH):** Often elevated in severe vitamin D deficiency (secondary hyperparathyroidism) as the body tries to raise calcium levels.
    *   **Other tests:** Based on suspected underlying cause (e.g., celiac serology for malabsorption).

### **41. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**

-   **Symptoms**: A sudden decrease in kidney function that occurs over hours to days. Can range from a mild decrease in function to complete kidney failure. Symptoms depend on the severity and underlying cause. May be asymptomatic, especially in early stages. When symptoms occur, they can include decreased urine output (oliguria or anuria - though urine output can be normal in some types of AKI), swelling in the legs and ankles (edema), fatigue, shortness of breath, confusion, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and chest pain or pressure (if fluid buildup affects the heart).
-   **Demographics**: Can occur in individuals of any age but is more common in hospitalized patients, especially those in critical care. Risk factors include advanced age, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease, sepsis, dehydration, exposure to nephrotoxic medications (e.g., certain antibiotics, NSAIDs, contrast dyes), and urinary tract obstruction.
-   **Medications/Management**: Management focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause, preventing further kidney damage, and managing complications.
    *   **Identifying and Treating the Cause:** This is the most critical step. Causes are often categorized as prerenal (reduced blood flow to the kidneys - e.g., dehydration, heart failure, blood loss), intrinsic (damage to the kidney itself - e.g., acute tubular necrosis from ischemia or toxins, glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis), or postrenal (obstruction of urine outflow - e.g., kidney stones, enlarged prostate, tumors).
    *   **Fluid Management:** Administering intravenous fluids for prerenal causes, or restricting fluids for patients with fluid overload.
    *   **Medication Review:** Discontinuing or adjusting nephrotoxic medications.
    *   **Managing Electrolyte Imbalances:** Treating hyperkalemia (high potassium), hyponatremia (low sodium), hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate), and metabolic acidosis.
    *   **Diuretics:** May be used to help remove excess fluid, but do not treat the underlying kidney damage.
    *   **Renal Replacement Therapy (Dialysis):** May be necessary for severe AKI with complications like severe fluid overload, refractory hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, or uremic symptoms.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD - gradual loss of function over months to years), Glomerulonephritis, Interstitial nephritis, Vasculitis affecting the kidneys, Obstructive uropathy (e.g., bilateral kidney stones, prostate enlargement, bladder obstruction).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Significant decrease or absence of urine output.**
    *   **Signs of fluid overload:** Severe edema, shortness of breath, crackles in the lungs, elevated jugular venous pressure.
    *   **Symptoms of uremia:** Severe fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, muscle twitching.
    *   **Severe electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hyperkalemia, which can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.**
    *   **Severe metabolic acidosis.**
    *   **Flank pain or inability to urinate:** Suggests urinary tract obstruction.
    *   **Symptoms in a patient with a single functioning kidney or a kidney transplant.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N17.9 (Acute kidney failure, unspecified). More specific codes exist for AKI with tubular necrosis (N17.0), acute cortical necrosis (N17.1), acute medullary necrosis (N17.2), and other specified AKI (N17.8).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Serum creatinine and BUN:** Rapid increase indicates AKI.
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** To assess electrolytes, glucose, and bicarbonate.
    *   **Urinalysis:** Can provide clues to the cause (e.g., casts, protein, blood).
    *   **Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea):** Can help differentiate prerenal AKI from acute tubular necrosis.
    *   **Renal ultrasound:** Essential to evaluate for urinary tract obstruction. Can also assess kidney size.
    *   **Kidney biopsy:** May be performed in select cases to determine the cause of intrinsic kidney injury (e.g., glomerulonephritis).

### **42. Kidney Stones (Nephrolithiasis)**

-   **Symptoms**: Solid deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys. Can affect any part of the urinary tract, from the kidneys to the bladder. Symptoms typically occur when a stone moves into the ureter, blocking urine flow. This causes severe, sharp pain (renal colic) in the back or side, below the ribs, which may radiate to the lower abdomen and groin. The pain often comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, hematuria (blood in the urine - may be visible or microscopic), painful urination, urgency, and frequency. If infection is present along with obstruction, fever and chills may occur.
-   **Demographics**: More common in males than females. Incidence peaks between ages 20 and 50. Risk factors include a history of kidney stones, family history, dehydration, certain diets (high in protein, sodium, or oxalate), obesity, certain medical conditions (e.g., gout, IBD, hyperparathyroidism), and certain medications.
-   **Medications**: Treatment focuses on pain management, helping the stone pass, and preventing future stones.
    *   **Pain Management:** NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, ketorolac) are often very effective for renal colic. Opioids may be needed for severe pain.
    *   **Medical Expulsive Therapy:** Alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin) can help relax the muscles in the ureter, facilitating stone passage, particularly for smaller stones.
    *   **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of fluids is important once nausea and vomiting are controlled.
    *   **Preventive Medications:** Based on the type of stone and risk factors, medications may be prescribed to prevent future stones (e.g., thiazide diuretics for calcium stones, allopurinol for uric acid stones, citrate preparations). Dietary modifications based on stone type are also important.
    *   **Procedures (if stone is large, not passing, causing obstruction with infection, or intractable pain):** Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL - uses shock waves to break up stones), Ureteroscopy (using a scope to remove or break up stones in the ureter or kidney), Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (for large kidney stones).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Urinary tract infection (UTI - especially pyelonephritis, which can cause flank pain and fever), Appendicitis (pain typically in the right lower quadrant, but can be atypical), Diverticulitis (pain typically in the left lower quadrant), Ovarian cysts or torsion, Ectopic pregnancy, Musculoskeletal back pain, Gallstones (biliary colic - pain typically in the right upper quadrant), Pancreatitis.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Fever (>38.5°C or 101.3°F) and chills in the presence of suspected kidney stones:** Suggests infected obstructed urinary tract, a urological emergency requiring urgent decompression (stenting or percutaneous nephrostomy) and antibiotics.
    *   **Severe pain that is not controlled with analgesics.**
    *   **Nausea and vomiting preventing oral intake and hydration.**
    *   **Anuria (no urine output):** Suggests bilateral obstruction (if both kidneys are functioning) or obstruction in a patient with a single functioning kidney. **Urological emergency.**
    *   **Acute kidney injury (AKI):** Can occur due to obstruction.
    *   **Symptoms in a patient with a kidney transplant.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N20.0 (Calculus of kidney). N20.1 (Calculus of ureter). N20.2 (Calculus of kidney with calculus of ureter).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Urinalysis:** To check for hematuria, signs of infection (pyuria, bacteria), and urine pH (helpful for identifying stone type).
    *   **Urine culture:** To check for bacterial infection.
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** To assess renal function (creatinine, BUN) and electrolytes (calcium).
    *   **Imaging:**
        *   **CT scan (non-contrast helical CT):** The most sensitive and specific imaging study for detecting kidney stones.
        *   **Renal ultrasound:** Can detect stones (especially in the kidney and proximal ureter) and hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidney due to obstruction), and avoids radiation, often used in pregnant women or children.
        *   **Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder (KUB) X-ray:** Can detect radiopaque stones but is less sensitive than CT.
    *   **Stone analysis:** If a stone is passed or retrieved, analysis helps determine its composition (e.g., calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, uric acid, struvite, cystine) to guide preventive therapy.
    *   **24-hour urine collection:** May be done in patients with recurrent stones or high risk to assess for metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, low citrate) that contribute to stone formation.

### **43. Prostatitis**

-   **Symptoms**: Inflammation of the prostate gland. Can be acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), or asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. Symptoms vary depending on the type.
    *   **Acute bacterial prostatitis:** Sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise, body aches, frequent urination, urgency, dysuria (painful urination), difficulty starting or stopping urination, weak urine stream, pain in the lower back, pelvis, or genital area. The prostate may be tender and swollen on digital rectal examination (DRE).
    *   **Chronic bacterial prostatitis:** Recurrent UTIs with the same bacteria, sometimes with milder versions of the symptoms of acute bacterial prostatitis.
    *   **Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS):** Pelvic pain lasting at least 3 of the past 6 months, often with urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria), and/or pain with ejaculation. No evidence of bacterial infection. The most common type.
    *   **Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis:** Inflammation of the prostate found incidentally (e.g., during evaluation for elevated PSA) without symptoms.
-   **Demographics**: Acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis are more common in younger and middle-aged men. CP/CPPS can affect men of any age. Risk factors for bacterial prostatitis include UTIs, catheterization, prostate biopsy, and sexually transmitted infections. The cause of CP/CPPS is often unclear, potentially involving inflammation, nerve problems, or muscle tension.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the type of prostatitis.
    *   **Acute bacterial prostatitis:** Requires antibiotics, typically for 4-6 weeks. Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) are commonly used as they penetrate prostate tissue well. Hospitalization and IV antibiotics may be needed for severe cases. Alpha-blockers may help with urinary symptoms.
    *   **Chronic bacterial prostatitis:** Requires longer courses of antibiotics (e.g., 4-6 weeks or longer).
    *   **Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS):** Treatment is often multimodal and can be challenging. Alpha-blockers, anti-inflammatories, pain relievers, muscle relaxants, physical therapy (pelvic floor), behavioral therapy, and sometimes antibiotics (even without documented infection) may be tried.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Urinary tract infection (UTI - in men, often associated with prostatitis or structural issues), Epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis - pain and swelling in the scrotum, often with fever), Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH - causes urinary symptoms but typically not pain or fever), Prostate cancer (usually asymptomatic in early stages, can cause urinary symptoms or pain in advanced stages), Bladder infection, Urethritis, STIs, Interstitial cystitis.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **High fever, chills, severe pain, and inability to urinate (acute urinary retention):** Suggests acute bacterial prostatitis, which can lead to sepsis. Requires urgent medical attention and often hospitalization for IV antibiotics.
    *   **Severe systemic toxicity.**
    *   **Symptoms of spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome** (rare, but can occur with prostatic abscess extending into the spinal canal).
    *   **Hematuria:** While can occur, warrants investigation to rule out other causes.
    *   **Elevated PSA in the absence of infection:** May raise suspicion for prostate cancer, though PSA is often elevated in prostatitis.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N41.9 (Inflammatory disease of prostate, unspecified). More specific codes exist for acute (N41.0), chronic (N41.1), and abscess of prostate (N41.2), and prostatocystitis (N41.3). CP/CPPS may be coded under pelvic pain (R10.2).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Urinalysis and urine culture:** Essential to check for infection. In acute bacterial prostatitis, the urine culture is typically positive. In chronic bacterial prostatitis, the urine culture may be negative between episodes, but a culture of prostatic secretions or post-massage urine may be positive.
    *   **Digital Rectal Examination (DRE):** The prostate may be tender, swollen, and warm in acute bacterial prostatitis. Gentle palpation is recommended to avoid bacteremia.
    *   **PSA:** Often elevated in acute and chronic prostatitis. Should be interpreted cautiously in this setting.
    *   **CBC:** May show leukocytosis in acute bacterial prostatitis.

### **44. Erectile Dysfunction (ED)**

-   **Symptoms**: The inability to achieve and maintain an erection firm enough for satisfactory sexual intercourse. Can occur occasionally or consistently. Symptoms may include difficulty getting an erection, difficulty keeping an erection, or reduced sexual desire. ED can be a symptom of underlying physical or psychological conditions and is an important indicator of cardiovascular health.
-   **Demographics**: Prevalence increases with age, but it is not a normal part of aging. Affects men of all ages. Risk factors include cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, hormonal imbalances (e.g., low testosterone), neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury), psychological factors (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression), certain medications (e.g., antihypertensives, antidepressants), pelvic surgery or radiation, and Peyronie's disease (scar tissue in the penis).
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the underlying cause and patient preferences. Lifestyle modifications and addressing underlying conditions are crucial.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss (if overweight or obese), smoking cessation, limiting alcohol intake.
    *   **Addressing Underlying Conditions:** Managing diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia. Screening for and treating depression or anxiety. Reviewing and adjusting medications.
    *   **Pharmacological Therapy:**
        *   Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) are the most common first-line treatment. They increase blood flow to the penis in response to sexual stimulation.
        *   Alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) can be administered as an intracavernosal injection or urethral suppository.
    *   **Other Treatments:** Vacuum erection devices, Penile implants (surgical).
    *   **Testosterone Replacement Therapy:** May be considered for men with documented low testosterone levels and symptoms of hypogonadism (including ED), but should be used cautiously and is contraindicated in men with prostate or breast cancer.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Psychological factors (performance anxiety, stress, depression, relationship issues), Cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis is a major cause), Diabetes mellitus (can cause neuropathy and vascular damage), Hormonal imbalances (low testosterone, hyperprolactinemia), Neurological disorders, Peyronie's disease, Medication side effects, Anatomical abnormalities.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **ED occurring in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking) who has not had a cardiovascular workup:** ED can be an early sign of atherosclerosis and increased risk of heart attack or stroke. Warrants cardiovascular risk assessment.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of hormonal imbalance beyond ED (e.g., gynecomastia, decreased body hair, reduced testicular size):** Warrants hormonal evaluation.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of an underlying neurological disorder.**
    *   **Sudden onset of ED without a clear psychological trigger:** Could indicate a vascular or neurological event.
    *   **Priapism (a prolonged erection lasting more than 4 hours):** A medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent penile tissue damage.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N52.9 (Male erectile dysfunction, unspecified). More specific codes exist if the cause is known (e.g., vascular, neurogenic, psychogenic).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Guided by suspected underlying causes.
    *   **Fasting glucose or HbA1c:** To screen for diabetes.
    *   **Lipid panel:** To screen for dyslipidemia.
    *   **Testosterone level (usually measured in the morning):** To screen for hypogonadism. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may also be checked.
    *   **Prolactin level:** If hyperprolactinemia is suspected.
    *   **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH):** To rule out thyroid dysfunction.
    *   **PSA:** May be checked before starting testosterone therapy.
    *   **Further investigations:** Penile Doppler ultrasound (to assess blood flow), nocturnal penile tumescence testing, psychological evaluation.

### **45. Vaginitis**

-   **Symptoms**: Inflammation of the vagina, commonly caused by infections (bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, trichomoniasis) or non-infectious conditions (e.g., allergic reactions, irritants, atrophic vaginitis). Symptoms can vary depending on the cause but often include abnormal vaginal discharge (changes in color, odor, or amount), vaginal itching (pruritus), burning, irritation, pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), and sometimes dysuria (painful urination).
-   **Demographics**: Very common in women of reproductive age. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause. *Candida* vulvovaginitis (yeast infection) is also frequent. Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Risk factors vary with the cause but include changes in vaginal flora (e.g., douching, antibiotic use), sexual activity (for trichomoniasis and sometimes BV), hormonal changes (e.g., menopause leading to atrophic vaginitis), diabetes, and weakened immune system.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the specific cause.
    *   **Bacterial Vaginosis (BV):** Treated with antibiotics (e.g., oral or vaginal metronidazole, clindamycin).
    *   ***Candida* Vulvovaginitis (Yeast Infection):** Treated with antifungal medications (e.g., topical antifungal creams or suppositories like clotrimazole, miconazole, tioconazole; or oral fluconazole).
    *   **Trichomoniasis:** Treated with oral metronidazole or tinidazole. Sexual partners also need treatment to prevent reinfection.
    *   **Atrophic Vaginitis (due to estrogen deficiency, typically after menopause):** Treated with topical or systemic estrogen therapy.
    *   **Non-infectious Vaginitis:** Identifying and avoiding the irritant or allergen.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix - can cause discharge and bleeding), STIs (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea - can cause discharge, cervicitis, pelvic pain), Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID - infection of the upper reproductive tract, often with pelvic pain, fever, and discharge), Foreign body in the vagina, Allergic reaction (e.g., to soaps, douches, lubricants), Irritant contact dermatitis, Physiologic discharge, Vulvodynia (chronic vulvar pain).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Fever or chills:** Suggests upper reproductive tract infection (PID) or other systemic infection.
    *   **Severe pelvic pain:** Raises suspicion for PID, tubo-ovarian abscess, appendicitis, or other acute abdominal/pelvic pathology.
    *   **Abnormal vaginal bleeding (especially post-coital or intermenstrual bleeding) in conjunction with discharge or pain:** Warrants investigation for cervical or endometrial issues.
    *   **Symptoms of a systemic illness.**
    *   **Recurrent or persistent symptoms despite appropriate treatment:** May require further investigation to confirm diagnosis, assess for resistance, or identify underlying factors.
    *   **Symptoms of potential STI exposure:** Warrants testing for multiple STIs.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N76.9 (Vaginitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for specific types: N76.0 (Acute vaginitis), N76.1 (Subacute and chronic vaginitis), B37.3 (Candidiasis of vulva and vagina), A59.01 (Trichomonal vaginitis), N76.2 (Acute vulvitis), N76.3 (Subacute and chronic vulvitis), N76.81 (Superinfection of vulva and vagina), N95.2 (Atrophic vaginitis).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Diagnosis is typically based on history, physical examination (including speculum examination), and laboratory tests of vaginal discharge.
    *   **Microscopic examination of vaginal discharge:** Saline wet mount (to look for clue cells suggestive of BV, motile trichomonads), KOH prep ("whiff test" for fishy odor suggests BV, helps identify yeast).
    *   **Vaginal pH testing:** Elevated pH (>4.5) is typical in BV and trichomoniasis, normal in candidiasis.
    *   **Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs):** Highly sensitive tests for detecting *Trichomonas vaginalis*, *Chlamydia trachomatis*, and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* from vaginal swabs. Recommended if STIs are suspected.
    *   **Fungal culture:** If candidiasis is suspected but wet mount is negative, or for recurrent yeast infections.
    *   **Bacterial culture:** Rarely needed for routine vaginitis.

### **46. Menopause and Perimenopause Symptoms**

-   **Symptoms**: Menopause is the time that marks the end of a woman's menstrual cycles, diagnosed after 12 consecutive months without a period. Perimenopause is the transitional period leading up to menopause, which can last for several years. Symptoms are caused by declining estrogen levels.
    *   **Common symptoms:** Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes - sudden feelings of warmth, often with sweating, especially at night; night sweats), menstrual irregularities (in perimenopause, periods become less predictable, heavier, lighter, or skipped), vaginal dryness, discomfort during intercourse (dyspareunia), urinary symptoms (urgency, frequency, increased UTIs), sleep disturbances (often due to hot flashes or night sweats), mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression), difficulty concentrating ("brain fog"), fatigue, hair thinning, dry skin, weight gain (often abdominal), joint aches and stiffness.
    *   **Long-term consequences of estrogen deficiency:** Increased risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause.
-   **Demographics**: Menopause typically occurs around age 51 in the developed world, but the perimenopausal transition can begin in the 40s. Surgical removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy) causes immediate surgical menopause.
-   **Medications/Management**: Management focuses on alleviating bothersome symptoms and mitigating long-term health risks. Treatment is individualized.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Healthy diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding triggers for hot flashes (e.g., spicy foods, hot drinks, alcohol, caffeine), smoking cessation.
    *   **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) or Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT):** The most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Involves taking estrogen, often combined with progesterone (for women with a uterus to protect against endometrial cancer). Available in various forms (pills, patches, gels, sprays, vaginal rings/creams/tablets). Benefits and risks should be discussed with each patient, considering age, time since menopause, dose, duration of use, and route of administration.
    *   **Non-hormonal Medications for Vasomotor Symptoms:** SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine, escitalopram), SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine), Gabapentin, Clonidine.
    *   **For Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause:** Vaginal estrogen therapy (low-dose, has minimal systemic absorption), Ospemifene (an oral SERM), vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.
    *   **For Osteoporosis Prevention/Treatment:** Calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise, and anti-resorptive or anabolic medications (as discussed in the Osteoporosis section).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Thyroid dysfunction (hyper- or hypothyroidism can cause menstrual irregularities, mood changes, fatigue, temperature sensitivity), Depression, Anxiety disorder, Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), Pheochromocytoma (rare, causing episodic symptoms), Medication side effects, Other causes of irregular bleeding (in perimenopause).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms (in perimenopause or postmenopause):**
    *   **Any postmenopausal bleeding (bleeding occurring after 12 consecutive months without a period):** Requires urgent investigation (transvaginal ultrasound and often endometrial biopsy) to rule out endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer.
    *   **Persistent abnormal bleeding in perimenopause (e.g., very heavy or prolonged bleeding, bleeding between periods) that is not typical of the transition:** Warrants investigation.
    *   **New onset or worsening symptoms that could indicate other serious conditions (e.g., chest pain - consider cardiovascular disease, significant weight loss - consider malignancy).**
    *   **Severe mood disturbances or suicidal ideation.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N95.1 (Menopausal and female climacteric states). N95.0 (Postmenopausal bleeding). N95.2 (Atrophic vaginitis).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Diagnosis of menopause is clinical (12 months amenorrhea). Hormonal tests are generally not needed to diagnose menopause in women in the typical age range with classic symptoms, but may be done in younger women or those with atypical presentations.
    *   **Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Estradiol:** FSH levels are typically elevated and estradiol levels are low in menopause. Levels can fluctuate in perimenopause.
    *   **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH):** To rule out thyroid dysfunction.
    *   **Other tests:** Based on differential diagnoses or comorbidities (e.g., lipid panel, fasting glucose, bone density scan for osteoporosis screening).
    *   **Pelvic ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy:** Indicated for abnormal or postmenopausal bleeding.

### **47. Lyme Disease**

-   **Symptoms**: A tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi*, transmitted primarily through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks (deer ticks). Symptoms vary depending on the stage of infection.
    *   **Early localized stage (days to weeks after bite):** The most characteristic symptom is the erythema migrans rash, a slowly expanding circular or oval red rash, often with central clearing ("bull's-eye" appearance). It is usually painless and non-itchy and occurs at the site of the tick bite (though the patient may not recall a tick bite). Other symptoms can include fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, headache, and swollen lymph nodes.
    *   **Early disseminated stage (weeks to months after bite):** The bacteria spread in the body. Symptoms can include multiple erythema migrans rashes, Bell's palsy (facial drooping), meningitis (headache, stiff neck, fever), radiculopathy (nerve pain, numbness, or weakness), Lyme carditis (heart palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath due to heart block), and migratory joint pain.
    *   **Late disseminated stage (months to years after bite):** Can cause Lyme arthritis (recurrent episodes of joint swelling and pain, most commonly in the knees), chronic neurological symptoms (e.g., nerve pain, numbness, tingling, cognitive disturbances - though some chronic symptoms are debated).
-   **Demographics**: Occurs in areas where infected blacklegged ticks are found, primarily in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and upper Midwestern United States, and in certain areas of Europe and Asia. Risk factors include spending time outdoors in wooded or grassy areas in endemic regions, particularly during warmer months when ticks are most active.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves antibiotics. The choice and duration of antibiotic therapy depend on the stage of the disease and the specific symptoms.
    *   **For early localized Lyme disease (erythema migrans):** Oral doxycycline (drug of choice in adults and children ≥8 years old), amoxicillin, or cefuroxime are typically prescribed for 10-14 days.
    *   **For early disseminated or late disseminated Lyme disease (e.g., Lyme carditis, meningitis, arthritis):** Longer courses of oral antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline) or sometimes intravenous antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone) may be required. Duration varies depending on the manifestation.
    *   **Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS):** Some individuals may experience persistent symptoms (fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain, cognitive difficulties) after completing antibiotic treatment. The cause is not fully understood, and prolonged antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended for PTLDS as it has not shown benefit and carries risks. Symptomatic management is the focus.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Other tick-borne illnesses (e.g., Anaplasmosis, Ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever - often with fever, headache, malaise, and sometimes rash, but distinct from erythema migrans), Viral exanthems, Cellulitis (bacterial skin infection, typically more rapid onset and spreading), Rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory arthropathies, Septic arthritis, Fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Multiple sclerosis or other neurological disorders, Psychosomatic illness.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Neurological deficits:** New onset facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy), symptoms of meningitis (severe headache, stiff neck, fever), radiculopathy (severe nerve pain or weakness).
    *   **Symptoms of Lyme carditis:** Palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, fainting, chest pain. May indicate heart block requiring urgent cardiac evaluation.
    *   **Acute, severe joint pain and swelling:** While Lyme arthritis can cause joint swelling, acute severe monoarticular arthritis should also raise suspicion for septic arthritis.
    *   **Rash that is atypical or not consistent with erythema migrans but in a patient with tick exposure and systemic symptoms:** Consider other tick-borne illnesses.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: A69.20 (Lyme disease, unspecified). More specific codes exist for Lyme disease with specific manifestations (e.g., A69.21 for meningitis, A69.23 for arthritis, A69.22 for carditis).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Diagnosis is often based on clinical presentation, particularly the presence of erythema migrans in an endemic area. Serological testing can support the diagnosis but should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings and exposure history.
    *   **Two-tiered serological testing:**
        *   **First step:** Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies to *Borrelia burgdorferi*. If negative, no further testing is usually needed unless there is strong clinical suspicion of very early disease.
        *   **Second step:** If the ELISA is positive or equivocal, a Western blot test is performed to confirm the presence of specific antibodies. Both IgM and IgG Western blots may be done depending on the duration of symptoms.
    *   **Testing of synovial fluid or cerebrospinal fluid:** May be performed in specific manifestations like Lyme arthritis (synovial fluid PCR for *B. burgdorferi*) or neuroborreliosis (CSF analysis).
    *   **CBC, ESR, CRP:** May show non-specific abnormalities.

### **48. Acute Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis**

-   **Symptoms**: Acute inflammation of the pharynx and/or tonsils, commonly known as a sore throat. Symptoms include throat pain (often worse with swallowing), redness and swelling of the pharynx and tonsils, and sometimes white patches or streaks (exudates) on the tonsils (more suggestive of streptococcal infection or mononucleosis). Other symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches, and swollen, tender lymph nodes in the neck. Cough, rhinorrhea (runny nose), and congestion are more suggestive of a viral cause. Streptococcal pharyngitis ("strep throat") is a bacterial cause that can lead to complications like rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis if not treated, but most pharyngitis is viral.
-   **Demographics**: Very common, particularly in children aged 5-15 for streptococcal pharyngitis. Viral pharyngitis affects all age groups. Spread through respiratory droplets.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the cause (viral or bacterial).
    *   **For Viral Pharyngitis:** Treatment is symptomatic. Rest, hydration, warm salt water gargles, lozenges, and over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) for pain and fever. Antibiotics are ineffective and should not be used.
    *   **For Streptococcal Pharyngitis:** Antibiotics are prescribed to prevent complications and reduce the duration and spread of illness. Penicillin or amoxicillin are typically first-line. Azithromycin or clindamycin may be used for penicillin-allergic patients. A full course of antibiotics is necessary.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Viral pharyngitis (most common cause), Streptococcal pharyngitis (bacterial cause), Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus, often with significant fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and sometimes splenomegaly), Adenovirus infection, Influenza, Common cold (URTI), Coxsackievirus (hand, foot, and mouth disease), Allergies, Peritonsillar abscess (a collection of pus behind the tonsil, causing severe unilateral sore throat, difficulty swallowing, trismus - difficulty opening the mouth, and deviation of the uvula - **medical emergency**), Epiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottis, causing severe sore throat, pain with swallowing, drooling, and difficulty breathing - **medical emergency**), Gonococcal pharyngitis, Diphtheria (rare in vaccinated populations).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Difficulty breathing or stridor (high-pitched sound during breathing):** Suggests airway obstruction (e.g., epiglottitis, severe tonsillar swelling).
    *   **Difficulty swallowing or inability to swallow saliva (drooling):** Can indicate epiglottitis or severe peritonsillar abscess.
    *   **Severe, unilateral sore throat with trismus and deviation of the uvula:** Highly suggestive of peritonsillar abscess.
    *   **High fever (>38.5°C or 101.3°F) with severe systemic symptoms.**
    *   **Neck stiffness or neurological symptoms:** Rare, but could indicate complications like meningitis.
    *   **Rash (e.g., scarlatiniform rash of scarlet fever, a complication of strep throat).**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J02.9 (Acute pharyngitis, unspecified). J03.90 (Acute tonsillitis, unspecified). B95.0 (Streptococcus, group A as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Rapid strep test or throat culture:** Recommended for patients with symptoms suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis (e.g., fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, absence of cough/rhinorrhea). A positive rapid strep test can be treated. A negative rapid strep test in children should be followed by a throat culture due to higher risk of rheumatic fever. Throat culture is the gold standard but takes 24-48 hours.
    *   **Monospot test or EBV serology:** If mononucleosis is suspected.
    *   **CBC:** May be done if systemic symptoms are severe or to evaluate for mononucleosis.

### **49. Constipation**

-   **Symptoms**: Infrequent bowel movements (typically less than three per week) or difficulty passing stools. Symptoms can include hard or lumpy stools, straining during bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, a sensation of anorectal blockage, and needing manual maneuvers to facilitate a bowel movement. Abdominal bloating, discomfort, and pain are also common. Constipation can be acute or chronic.
-   **Demographics**: Common in all age groups, particularly in the elderly, pregnant women, and children. More common in females than males. Often functional, but can be caused by diet (low fiber, low fluid), lifestyle (sedentary), medications, or underlying medical conditions.
-   **Medications**: Treatment often begins with lifestyle and dietary changes, followed by laxatives if needed.
    *   **Lifestyle and Dietary Modifications:** Increasing dietary fiber intake (gradually to avoid bloating and gas), increasing fluid intake, regular physical activity, establishing a regular bowel routine and not delaying the urge to defecate.
    *   **Laxatives (used if lifestyle changes are insufficient):**
        *   Bulk-forming laxatives (e.g., psyllium, methylcellulose) increase stool bulk and water content. Require adequate fluid intake.
        *   Osmotic laxatives (e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), lactulose, magnesium hydroxide) draw water into the colon to soften stool.
        *   Stool softeners (e.g., docusate) moisten the stool.
        *   Stimulant laxatives (e.g., senna, bisacodyl) stimulate intestinal muscle contractions. Generally used for short periods to avoid dependence.
        *   Chloride channel activators (e.g., lubiprostone) and Guanylate cyclase-C agonists (e.g., linaclotide, plecanatide) are prescription medications for chronic idiopathic constipation and IBS-C.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Functional constipation (most common), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C subtype - constipation associated with abdominal pain), Medications (e.g., opioids, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, iron supplements, certain antidepressants), Structural abnormalities of the colon or rectum (e.g., stricture, tumor, diverticular disease, anal fissure, hemorrhoids), Metabolic disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, diabetes), Neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury), Pelvic floor dysfunction, Pregnancy, Ignoring the urge to defecate habitually.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Symptoms that suggest a more serious underlying cause.
    *   **New onset or worsening constipation in older adults (e.g., over 50):** Warrants investigation to rule out colorectal cancer or other structural issues.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** Raises suspicion for malignancy or malabsorption.
    *   **Hematochezia (blood in the stool):** Requires investigation (e.g., colonoscopy) to rule out colorectal cancer, polyps, diverticulosis, or IBD.
    *   **Anemia (iron deficiency):** May indicate chronic blood loss.
    *   **Severe abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and vomiting:** Could indicate bowel obstruction. **Medical emergency.**
    *   **Narrowing of stool caliber that is persistent.**
    *   **Family history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease.**

### **50. Vertigo and Dizziness**

-   **Symptoms**: Vertigo is the sensation of spinning or whirling, either of oneself or the surroundings. Dizziness is a broader term that can include feelings of lightheadedness, faintness, unsteadiness, or a swimming sensation in the head. Causes can be peripheral (originating in the inner ear or vestibular nerve) or central (originating in the brain, e.g., brainstem or cerebellum). Peripheral causes are much more common in primary care.
    *   **Peripheral Vertigo:** Often sudden onset, severe vertigo, often triggered by head movement, associated with nausea, vomiting, and sometimes hearing loss or tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Examples include Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), Vestibular neuritis, Labyrinthitis, Meniere's disease.
    *   **Central Vertigo/Dizziness:** Often gradual onset, less severe vertigo but constant, may be associated with other neurological symptoms (e.g., double vision, difficulty speaking or swallowing, weakness, numbness, gait instability), not typically affected by head position, hearing loss and tinnitus are usually absent or less prominent. Examples include stroke, TIA, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, migraine-associated vertigo.
    *   **Lightheadedness/Presyncope:** Feeling faint or about to pass out. Can be caused by orthostatic hypotension, cardiac issues (arrhythmias, valvular disease), dehydration, anemia, or medication side effects.
    *   **Disequilibrium/Unsteadiness:** Feeling unsteady or off-balance when walking, usually without a spinning sensation. Can be caused by peripheral neuropathy, musculoskeletal issues, visual problems, or central neurological disorders.
-   **Demographics**: Dizziness is a very common symptom across all age groups, particularly in older adults. BPPV is more common with increasing age. Vestibular neuritis can occur at any age. Meniere's disease typically affects adults aged 20-50.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the underlying cause.
    *   **For BPPV:** Particle repositioning maneuvers (e.g., Epley maneuver) are highly effective in moving displaced crystals in the inner ear.
    *   **For Vestibular Neuritis/Labyrinthitis:** Vestibular suppressants (e.g., meclizine, dimenhydrinate, benzodiazepines) and antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) for acute symptoms. Corticosteroids may be used. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises are important for long-term recovery.
    *   **For Meniere's Disease:** Dietary changes (low salt), diuretics, sometimes intratympanic steroid injections or surgery.
    *   **For Migraine-Associated Vertigo:** Migraine preventive medications (e.g., beta-blockers, topiramate).
    *   **For Orthostatic Hypotension:** Lifestyle modifications (e.g., increasing fluid and salt intake, slow position changes), sometimes medications (e.g., fludrocortisone, midodrine).
    *   **Avoid vestibular suppressants long-term for chronic dizziness**, as they can hinder central compensation.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), Vestibular neuritis (inflammation of the vestibular nerve), Labyrinthitis (inflammation of the labyrinth, affecting both vestibular and auditory function), Meniere's disease (recurrent vertigo attacks with hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness), Migraine-associated vertigo, Stroke or TIA (especially in the posterior circulation), Multiple sclerosis, Brain tumor (especially in the posterior fossa), Acoustic neuroma (tumor on the vestibulocochlear nerve, can cause dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus), Orthostatic hypotension, Cardiac arrhythmias, Anemia, Dehydration, Anxiety or panic disorder, Medication side effects, Peripheral neuropathy, Cerebellar degeneration.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Symptoms that suggest a central cause or other serious condition. Mnemonic "HINTS Plus" (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew, Plus gait, hearing, and cranial nerves) can help distinguish central from peripheral vertigo, particularly in acute vestibular syndrome.
    *   **Acute onset dizziness or vertigo with other neurological symptoms:** Double vision, difficulty speaking (dysarthria), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), weakness or numbness on one side of the body, facial drooping, incoordination, gait instability, severe headache, altered mental status. **Highly suspicious for stroke or other central pathology - Medical emergency.**
    *   **Dizziness that is constant and not triggered by movement, especially if associated with neurological signs.**
    *   **New onset severe headache with dizziness.**
    *   **Dizziness with hearing loss that does not improve.**
    *   **Abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) that are vertical, purely torsional, or change direction with gaze.**
    *   **Inability to stand or walk without assistance.**
    *   **Symptoms in a patient with risk factors for stroke (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, atrial fibrillation).**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: R42 (Dizziness and giddiness). More specific codes exist for specific causes like H81.1 (Benign paroxysmal vertigo), H81.2 (Vestibular neuritis), H81.0 (Meniere's disease).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Often based on clinical examination (including detailed neurological and otological exams, and assessment of eye movements and balance). Investigations are guided by suspected cause and presence of red flags.
    *   **Audiometry:** To assess hearing loss.
    *   **Videonystagmography (VNG) or electronystagmography (ENG):** Tests of vestibular function.
    *   **MRI of the brain:** Essential if a central cause is suspected (e.g., stroke, tumor, MS).
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** To check glucose, electrolytes, and renal function.
    *   **CBC:** To check for anemia.
    *   **Cardiac evaluation (EKG, Holter monitor):** If cardiac causes of lightheadedness are suspected.
    *   **Blood pressure and heart rate measurements (including orthostatic vital signs).**

### **51. Insomnia**

-   **Symptoms**: Difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or waking up too early and being unable to return to sleep, resulting in insufficient or poor quality sleep. This leads to daytime impairment, such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, mood disturbances, and reduced performance. Insomnia can be acute (lasting for a few days or weeks) or chronic (occurring at least three nights per week for at least three months).
-   **Demographics**: Common, affecting a significant portion of the population at some point. More prevalent in women, older adults, individuals with medical or psychiatric conditions, shift workers, and those experiencing stress.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves addressing underlying causes, behavioral therapies, and sometimes medications. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is considered the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia.
    *   **Behavioral Therapies (CBT-I):** Includes techniques such as sleep hygiene education, stimulus control (associating the bed with sleep), sleep restriction (limiting time in bed to consolidate sleep), relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring (challenging unhelpful thoughts about sleep).
    *   **Medications (typically used for short periods or in conjunction with CBT-I):**
        *   Hypnotics (sleep medications): Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., zolpidem, eszopiclone, zaleplon), Benzodiazepines (less commonly used for chronic insomnia due to dependence risk), Melatonin receptor agonists (e.g., ramelteon), Orexin receptor antagonists (e.g., suvorexant, lemborexant).
        *   Antidepressants with sedative properties (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine) may be used off-label, particularly if insomnia is associated with depression.
        *   Antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) are available over-the-counter but can cause daytime grogginess and anticholinergic side effects.
    *   **Addressing Underlying Causes:** Treating underlying medical conditions (e.g., pain, GERD, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea) or psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety) that may be contributing to insomnia. Reviewing and adjusting medications that may interfere with sleep.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Adjustment insomnia (related to an acute stressor), Chronic insomnia (primary or comorbid with medical/psychiatric conditions), Sleep apnea (characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, often with snoring and daytime sleepiness, not typically insomnia as the primary complaint), Restless legs syndrome (unpleasant urge to move the legs, particularly in the evening and at rest, interfering with sleep onset), Periodic limb movement disorder, Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (e.g., shift work disorder, delayed sleep phase syndrome), Medication side effects, Substance use (caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, illicit drugs) or withdrawal, Psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder), Medical conditions (e.g., chronic pain, heart failure, COPD, hyperthyroidism, neurological disorders), Poor sleep hygiene.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of untreated sleep apnea:** Loud snoring, observed pauses in breathing during sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate opportunity for sleep, morning headaches. Requires sleep study.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of restless legs syndrome:** Unpleasant sensations in the legs relieved by movement.
    *   **Symptoms of underlying medical or psychiatric conditions that require specific treatment.**
    *   **New onset severe insomnia or changes in sleep pattern associated with neurological symptoms.**
    *   **Excessive daytime sleepiness that is impairing function and not solely due to insufficient sleep opportunity.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: G47.00 (Insomnia, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different types of insomnia (e.g., acute, chronic, adjustment insomnia, paradoxical insomnia).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Generally not needed for the initial evaluation of uncomplicated insomnia. Investigations are indicated if an underlying medical or sleep disorder is suspected.
    *   **Sleep study (polysomnography):** The primary test for diagnosing sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, and other complex sleep disorders.
    *   **Actigraphy:** Wearing a wrist device to monitor sleep-wake patterns over several days or weeks.
    *   **Laboratory tests:** Based on suspected underlying medical conditions (e.g., TSH for thyroid dysfunction, ferritin for restless legs syndrome).

### **52. Obesity**

-   **Symptoms**: Defined by excess accumulation of body fat, typically measured using Body Mass Index (BMI) - weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). Overweight is defined as BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m². While not a disease in itself, obesity is a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases and has significant health consequences. Symptoms are often related to the associated comorbidities.
    *   **Common symptoms/consequences:** Shortness of breath (especially with exertion), fatigue, joint pain (especially in weight-bearing joints like knees and hips), sleep apnea (snoring, daytime sleepiness), acid reflux, increased sweating, skin fold rashes/infections, psychological distress (depression, anxiety), social stigma.
-   **Demographics**: Prevalence has increased significantly globally across all age groups. Affects males and females. More common in certain racial and ethnic groups and lower socioeconomic populations. Caused by a complex interaction of genetic, environmental (diet, physical activity), behavioral, and social factors.
-   **Medications**: Management involves lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise), behavioral therapy, and sometimes medications or surgery.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Reduced calorie intake through dietary changes, increased physical activity (aerobic and strength training), behavioral counseling.
    *   **Medications (for individuals with BMI ≥ 30 or BMI ≥ 27 with obesity-related comorbidities, who have not achieved sufficient weight loss with lifestyle interventions):** Prescription weight loss medications (e.g., orlistat - inhibits fat absorption; phentermine-topiramate, bupropion-naltrexone, liraglutide, semaglutide - affect appetite and satiety). Medication choice depends on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and potential side effects. Medications are typically used as an adjunct to lifestyle changes.
    *   **Bariatric Surgery (for individuals with severe obesity - BMI ≥ 40 or BMI ≥ 35 with significant obesity-related comorbidities, who have not achieved sufficient weight loss with other methods):** Procedures like Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or adjustable gastric banding. Can lead to significant and sustained weight loss and improvement or remission of comorbidities.
    *   **Addressing Comorbidities:** Managing associated conditions like hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, etc.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Endocrine causes of weight gain (rare): Cushing's syndrome, Hypothyroidism, Polycystic ovary syndrome (often with associated metabolic issues), Hypothalamic obesity (due to damage to the hypothalamus). Medication-induced weight gain (e.g., certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, corticosteroids, insulin, sulfonylureas). Genetic syndromes (rare).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: While obesity itself is a health concern, red flags are typically related to the complications or underlying causes.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome:** Rapid weight gain (especially central), round face, easy bruising, wide purple striae, proximal muscle weakness.
    *   **Symptoms of severe, untreated sleep apnea:** Loud snoring, observed pauses in breathing, excessive daytime sleepiness.
    *   **New onset or worsening symptoms of cardiovascular disease (chest pain, dyspnea) or stroke.**
    *   **Symptoms of type 2 diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia).**
    *   **Severe joint pain limiting mobility.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E66.9 (Obesity, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different classes of obesity based on BMI (E66.0 to E66.2) and for morbid obesity (E66.01, E66.2).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily involves assessing for obesity-related comorbidities and ruling out secondary causes.
    *   **Screening for comorbidities:** Fasting glucose or HbA1c (for type 2 diabetes), Lipid panel (for dyslipidemia), Blood pressure measurement, Liver function tests (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is common).
    *   **Further investigations if secondary causes are suspected:** Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Cortisol levels (if Cushing's syndrome is suspected), Hormonal assays (if PCOS is suspected in women).
    *   **Sleep study:** If sleep apnea is suspected.

### **53. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus**

-   **Symptoms**: An autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This results in an absolute deficiency of insulin. Symptoms typically develop rapidly over days to weeks and are often more severe than in type 2 diabetes. Classic symptoms include polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased hunger), and significant, often rapid, unintentional weight loss. Other symptoms include fatigue, blurred vision, and sometimes nausea and vomiting. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
-   **Demographics**: Most commonly diagnosed in children, adolescents, and young adults, but can occur at any age. Incidence is higher in individuals of European descent. Family history of type 1 diabetes increases risk. The exact cause is unknown but involves a genetic predisposition and environmental factors (e.g., viral infections) that trigger the autoimmune response.
-   **Medications**: Requires lifelong insulin therapy.
    *   **Insulin Therapy:** Insulin is administered by injection (using syringes or pens) or through an insulin pump. Various types of insulin exist (rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting) with different onset, peak, and duration profiles. Intensive insulin therapy (multiple daily injections or insulin pump) aims to mimic the body's physiological insulin secretion and maintain blood glucose levels within a target range.
    *   **Glucose Monitoring:** Regular blood glucose monitoring (using a glucose meter) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are essential for managing blood sugar levels and adjusting insulin doses.
    *   **Carbohydrate Counting:** Learning to count carbohydrates in food is crucial for matching insulin doses to food intake.
    *   **Other medications:** Non-insulin medications used in type 2 diabetes are generally not used for type 1 diabetes, except for some exceptions in adults (e.g., pramlintide as an adjunct to insulin, or SGLT2 inhibitors in select patients with close monitoring).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (typically later onset, often associated with obesity and insulin resistance, less acute presentation), Secondary diabetes (e.g., due to pancreatitis, Cushing's syndrome, certain medications). Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) is a slowly progressive form of autoimmune diabetes diagnosed in adulthood, often initially misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Symptoms of uncontrolled hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
    *   **Symptoms of DKA:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, deep and rapid breathing (Kussmaul respirations), fruity odor on the breath, confusion, lethargy, dehydration. **Medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization and IV fluids and insulin.**
    *   **Significant and rapid unintentional weight loss with classic symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia).**
    *   **New onset diabetes symptoms in a child or young adult.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E10.9 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus without complications). More specific codes exist for type 1 diabetes with specific complications or if in DKA (E10.1).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Fasting plasma glucose, Random plasma glucose, or Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT):** To diagnose diabetes based on blood glucose levels.
    *   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):** Reflects average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months.
    *   **Urine ketones and blood ketones:** Elevated in DKA.
    *   **Autoantibodies:** Islet cell autoantibodies (ICA), Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA or anti-GAD), Insulin autoantibodies (IAA), Tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 antibodies (IA-2A), Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) antibodies. Presence of these antibodies indicates the autoimmune destruction of beta cells and helps confirm the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.
    *   **C-peptide level:** A measure of endogenous insulin production. Typically very low or undetectable in established type 1 diabetes.
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** To assess electrolytes, renal function, and glucose.
    *   **Lipid panel:** To screen for dyslipidemia.

### **54. Hyperthyroidism**

-   **Symptoms**: Caused by excessive production of thyroid hormones. Symptoms reflect a hypermetabolic state and can include unintentional weight loss despite increased appetite, rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations), nervousness, anxiety, irritability, tremor (usually fine tremor in the hands), increased sweating, heat intolerance, changes in bowel patterns (often more frequent), difficulty sleeping, muscle weakness, and sometimes a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) or eye changes (proptosis or bulging eyes, often seen in Graves' disease). Symptoms can be subtle, especially in older adults.
-   **Demographics**: More common in females than males. Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder, is the most common cause in younger individuals, often occurring between ages 20-50. Toxic nodular goiter and toxic adenoma are more common causes in older adults. Other causes include thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid), excessive iodine intake, and certain medications.
-   **Medications**: Treatment aims to reduce thyroid hormone production and manage symptoms.
    *   **Antithyroid Medications (e.g., methimazole, propylthiouracil - PTU):** Inhibit the synthesis of thyroid hormones. PTU is preferred in the first trimester of pregnancy. Treatment duration varies but is often for 1-2 years.
    *   **Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, atenolol):** Help control symptoms like palpitations, tremor, anxiety, and rapid heart rate, particularly in the acute phase. They do not affect thyroid hormone levels but block their effects on the body.
    *   **Radioactive Iodine Therapy:** A common treatment, particularly for Graves' disease and toxic nodular goiter, where radioactive iodine is taken orally and destroys thyroid cells. Often leads to hypothyroidism, requiring lifelong thyroid hormone replacement.
    *   **Surgery (Thyroidectomy):** Removal of the thyroid gland may be an option for large goiters, suspicion of malignancy, or when other treatments are not suitable. Also leads to hypothyroidism.
    *   **Addressing Underlying Cause:** Treating thyroiditis if applicable.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Anxiety disorder (can cause nervousness, palpitations, tremor), Panic disorder, Pheochromocytoma (rare tumor causing episodic release of adrenaline with similar symptoms), Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias, Menopause (hot flashes, palpitations), Side effects of medications (e.g., stimulants, excessive thyroid hormone supplementation), Subclinical hyperthyroidism (low TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels, often asymptomatic).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Thyroid storm (thyrotoxic crisis):** A rare but life-threatening complication characterized by severe hyperthyroid symptoms along with fever, tachycardia out of proportion to fever, arrhythmias, altered mental status, vomiting, diarrhea, and sometimes heart failure or shock. **Medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization and aggressive treatment.**
    *   **Severe tachycardia or arrhythmias (e.g., rapid atrial fibrillation) with hemodynamic instability.**
    *   **New onset or worsening eye symptoms (proptosis, vision changes, eye pain) in Graves' disease.**
    *   **Signs of heart failure.**
    *   **Severe muscle weakness or periodic paralysis.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E05.90 (Hyperthyroidism, unspecified, without thyroid storm). More specific codes exist for Graves' disease (E05.0), toxic nodular goiter (E05.2), toxic adenoma (E05.1), thyroiditis (E06.-), and with thyroid storm (E05.91).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH):** The most sensitive initial test. Typically suppressed (low) in hyperthyroidism as the pituitary senses excess thyroid hormone and reduces TSH production.
    *   **Free Thyroxine (Free T4) and sometimes Free Triiodothyronine (Free T3):** Measure the levels of active thyroid hormones. Typically elevated in hyperthyroidism.
    *   **Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) or TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb):** To diagnose Graves' disease.
    *   **Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO Ab) or thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg Ab):** Can be elevated in autoimmune thyroiditis.
    *   **Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) and thyroid scan:** Imaging tests to assess the function and structure of the thyroid gland and help determine the cause of hyperthyroidism. RAIU is high in Graves' disease and toxic nodular goiter/adenoma, and low in thyroiditis.
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** To check electrolytes and liver function.
    *   **EKG:** To assess for cardiac arrhythmias.

### **55. Diverticular Disease (Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis)**

-   **Symptoms**: Diverticulosis is the presence of small pouches (diverticula) that bulge outward through the colon wall, often asymptomatic. Diverticulitis is inflammation or infection of these pouches. Symptoms of diverticulitis include abdominal pain (typically in the left lower quadrant), often constant and severe, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea).
-   **Demographics**: More common with age, particularly after 40. Risk factors include low-fiber diet, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and certain medications.
-   **Medications**: Treatment for diverticulitis involves rest, dietary changes (clear liquid diet during acute phase), and antibiotics for uncomplicated cases. Severe or complicated cases may require hospitalization, IV antibiotics, and potentially surgery.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Appendicitis, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Colitis, Colon cancer, Gynecological issues.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Severe abdominal pain, high fever, signs of peritonitis (rigid abdomen, rebound tenderness), inability to tolerate oral intake, signs of bleeding (hematochezia), signs of obstruction.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: K57.30 (Diverticulosis of large intestine without perforation or abscess). K57.32 (Diverticulitis of large intestine without perforation or abscess).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: CBC (leukocytosis in diverticulitis), CRP, imaging (CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is preferred for diagnosing diverticulitis and complications). Colonoscopy after resolution of acute diverticulitis to rule out other pathology.

---

### **56. Hemorrhoids**

-   **Symptoms**: Swollen veins in the lower rectum and anus. Can be internal (inside the rectum) or external (under the skin around the anus). Symptoms depend on the type. Internal hemorrhoids often cause painless bright red bleeding during or after a bowel movement, sometimes with prolapse (protruding from the anus). External hemorrhoids can cause itching, pain (especially if thrombosed - a blood clot forms within the hemorrhoid), and swelling around the anus.
-   **Demographics**: Very common, affects a large proportion of adults. Risk factors include straining during bowel movements (due to constipation or diarrhea), pregnancy, obesity, prolonged sitting, and a low-fiber diet.
-   **Medications**: Management involves lifestyle modifications and symptomatic treatment.
    *   **Lifestyle:** High-fiber diet, adequate fluid intake, avoiding straining, regular exercise.
    *   **Symptomatic:** Over-the-counter creams, ointments, or suppositories containing witch hazel, hydrocortisone, or lidocaine for itching, pain, and inflammation. Sitz baths (soaking in warm water).

### **72. Herpes Simplex (Oral and Genital)**

-   **Symptoms**: Infection caused by the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), typically HSV-1 (oral herpes, "cold sores") or HSV-2 (genital herpes). Initial infection can be asymptomatic or cause a more severe outbreak. Reactivation of the virus causes recurrent outbreaks, often in the same location.
    *   **Oral Herpes:** Prodromal symptoms (itching, tingling, burning) followed by the appearance of painful blisters, typically on the lips or around the mouth. Blisters rupture and crust over, healing within 1-2 weeks.
    *   **Genital Herpes:** Prodromal symptoms (itching, tingling, pain) followed by the appearance of painful blisters or sores in the genital or anal area. Blisters rupture to form ulcers, which can be very painful. May have fever, body aches, and swollen lymph nodes during the initial outbreak. Recurrent outbreaks are usually milder and shorter.
-   **Demographics**: HSV-1 is often acquired in childhood. HSV-2 is typically sexually transmitted. Both are very common globally.
-   **Medications**: Antiviral medications to suppress the virus, reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks, and prevent transmission.
    *   **Oral antivirals:** Acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir. Can be used for episodic treatment (starting at the first sign of an outbreak) or suppressive therapy (taken daily to reduce the frequency of outbreaks and transmission).
    *   **Topical antivirals:** Less effective than oral antivirals but may be used for mild oral herpes outbreaks.
    *   Pain relievers.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Aphthous ulcers (canker sores - painful mouth ulcers, not contagious), Hand, foot, and mouth disease (viral illness causing mouth sores and rash), Syphilis (chancre - painless ulcer), Chancroid (painful genital ulcer), Folliculitis, Contact dermatitis, Yeast infection.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Severe or widespread infection, especially in immunocompromised individuals, which can lead to complications like encephalitis or disseminated disease. Eye involvement (herpes keratitis) - can cause eye pain, redness, photophobia, blurred vision, and potentially vision loss - **ophthalmic emergency**. Neonatal herpes (severe infection in newborns, often acquired during childbirth).
-   **ICD-10 Code**: B00.9 (Herpesviral infection, unspecified). B00.1 (Herpesviral vesicular dermatitis). A60.0 (Herpesviral infection of genital and urogenital tracts). B00.2 (Herpesviral gingivostomatitis and pharyngotonsillitis).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Clinical diagnosis is often sufficient. Viral culture, PCR, or antigen detection tests can confirm the diagnosis, especially in atypical cases or for primary infection. Type-specific serology can determine if someone has been infected with HSV-1 and/or HSV-2, even if they haven't had recognized outbreaks.

### **73. Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**

-   **Symptoms**: Caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a chickenpox infection, VZV remains dormant in nerve roots. Reactivation typically occurs later in life. Symptoms begin with pain, itching, or tingling in a localized area, often followed within a few days by the appearance of a unilateral (one-sided) rash of fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) in a dermatomal distribution (along the path of a single nerve). The rash does not cross the midline of the body. Pain can be mild to severe and may persist after the rash clears (postherpetic neuralgia). May also have fever, headache, and malaise.
-   **Demographics**: More common in older adults (risk increases with age) and individuals with weakened immune systems. Having had chickenpox is a prerequisite. A vaccine is available to prevent shingles or reduce its severity.
-   **Medications**: Antiviral medications are the mainstay of treatment, particularly when started within 72 hours of rash onset, to reduce the severity and duration of pain and rash, and decrease the risk of postherpetic neuralgia.
    *   **Oral antivirals:** Acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, typically for 7 days.
    *   **Pain management:** Over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers, including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants for postherpetic neuralgia. Topical treatments (e.g., lidocaine patch, capsaicin cream).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Herpes simplex, Cellulitis, Contact dermatitis, Insect bites, Scabies, Impetigo.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Zoster ophthalmicus:** Involvement of the trigeminal nerve affecting the eye. Presents with rash on the forehead, tip of the nose, and around the eye, often with eye pain, redness, photophobia, and blurred vision. **Ophthalmic emergency requiring urgent ophthalmology consultation** to prevent vision loss.
    *   **Zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome):** Involvement of the facial nerve, affecting the ear. Presents with painful rash in the ear canal, on the earlobe, or around the ear, often with facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), hearing loss, and vertigo.
    *   **Motor weakness:** While less common, can occur in the affected dermatome.
    *   **Widespread or disseminated zoster:** Occurs more often in immunocompromised individuals, with rash spreading beyond a single dermatome.
    *   **Severe pain unresponsive to initial treatment.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: B02.9 (Zoster without complications). Specific codes exist for zoster with neurological manifestations (B02.2-), ophthalmic zoster (B02.3-), disseminated zoster (B02.7), and zoster with other complications.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Clinical diagnosis is usually sufficient. Viral PCR or culture can confirm the diagnosis if needed.

### **74. Dry Eye Syndrome**

-   **Symptoms**: A common condition where the eyes do not produce enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly. Symptoms include dryness, grittiness, burning, stinging, redness, blurred vision (that often improves with blinking), sensitivity to light, and sometimes paradoxical excessive tearing (reflex tearing due to irritation). Symptoms often worsen with activities that reduce blinking (e.g., reading, computer use) or in dry, windy, or smoky environments.
-   **Demographics**: More common with age, particularly after 50. More common in women, especially after menopause. Risk factors include certain medical conditions (e.g., Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, diabetes), certain medications (e.g., antihistamines, decongestants, certain antidepressants, hormone replacement therapy), contact lens wear, environmental factors (dry climate, wind, smoke), and prolonged screen time.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on alleviating symptoms and improving tear quality and production.
    *   **Artificial Tears:** Over-the-counter eye drops that supplement natural tears, used regularly throughout the day. Various types are available (different viscosities).
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Avoiding environmental triggers (wind, smoke), using a humidifier, taking breaks during screen time, ensuring adequate hydration.
    *   **Prescription Eye Drops:** Cyclosporine or lifitegrast eye drops can help reduce inflammation and increase tear production.
    *   **Other Treatments:** Punctal plugs (inserted into tear ducts to block drainage and keep tears on the eye surface), warm compresses and eyelid hygiene (for evaporative dry eye due to meibomian gland dysfunction), sometimes oral medications (e.g., doxycycline for meibomian gland dysfunction), or special contact lenses.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids), Conjunctivitis, Allergic conjunctivitis, Keratitis, Sjogren's syndrome (autoimmune disorder causing dry eyes and mouth), Medication side effects.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Significant eye pain, vision changes that do not improve with blinking, corneal opacity, severe photophobia, suggesting more serious conditions like keratitis or uveitis. Symptoms suggestive of an underlying systemic autoimmune disorder.

### **75. Blepharitis**

-   **Symptoms**: Chronic inflammation of the eyelids. Symptoms include redness, swelling, itching, and irritation of the eyelids. Crusting and flaking ("dandruff") may be present at the base of the eyelashes, particularly in the morning. Eyes may feel gritty, burning, or watery. Can cause mild light sensitivity and blurred vision. Often associated with dry eye syndrome and seborrheic dermatitis. Can be anterior (affecting the outside front of the eyelid where lashes are) or posterior (affecting the inner eyelid where meibomian glands are).
-   **Demographics**: Common, affects individuals of all ages. Can be associated with bacterial colonization of the eyelids, seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, or allergies.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on eyelid hygiene and controlling inflammation.
    *   **Eyelid Hygiene:** Warm compresses applied to the eyelids for several minutes to loosen crusts and improve meibomian gland function. Eyelid scrubs using diluted baby shampoo or commercially available eyelid cleansers to gently clean the eyelid margins and base of the eyelashes.
    *   **Topical Treatments:** Antibiotic ointments or solutions (e.g., erythromycin, bacitracin, azithromycin) may be used, particularly for bacterial blepharitis or if symptoms are severe. Topical corticosteroids (used cautiously for short periods) may be used for severe inflammation. Topical cyclosporine may be used if associated with dry eye.
    *   **Oral Treatments:** Oral antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline) may be used for posterior blepharitis (meibomian gland dysfunction) due to their anti-inflammatory properties, or for more severe bacterial blepharitis.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Conjunctivitis, Dry eye syndrome, Stye (hordeolum), Chalazion, Allergic reactions affecting the eyelids, Seborrheic dermatitis (can affect eyelids), Rosacea (can be associated with posterior blepharitis), Mites (Demodex) infestation of eyelashes.

-   **ICD-10 Code**: H01.00- (Blepharitis, unspecified). Specific codes exist for ulcerative (bacterial) and non-ulcerative blepharitis, and laterality.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Clinical diagnosis. Rarely needed. Eyelash epilation and microscopic examination may be done to check for Demodex mites. Culture of eyelid discharge may be done in severe or recurrent cases.

---

### **76. Stye (Hordeolum)**

-   **Symptoms**: An acute bacterial infection of an oil gland in the eyelid, typically a sebaceous gland (gland of Zeis) or an apocrine sweat gland (gland of Moll) for an external hordeolum, or a meibomian gland for an internal hordeolum. Presents as a painful, red, swollen lump on the eyelid. Often points externally (like a pimple) or internally towards the conjunctiva. May have a small spot of pus at the center.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age. Risk factors include blepharitis, seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, diabetes, and poor eyelid hygiene. Most commonly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*.
-   **Medications**: Management is often conservative.
    *   **Conservative:** Warm compresses applied to the affected eyelid for 10-15 minutes several times a day to help the stye come to a head and drain.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin) may be used, particularly if there is associated blepharitis or if the stye is large. Oral antibiotics may be needed if there is surrounding cellulitis or systemic symptoms.
    *   **Incision and Drainage:** May be necessary if the stye does not drain on its own or is very large and painful.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Chalazion (a non-infectious, chronic lump in the eyelid caused by a blocked meibomian gland, usually less painful than a stye), Blepharitis, Periorbital cellulitis (infection of the tissues around the eye, typically more widespread swelling and redness, often with fever), Preseptal cellulitis (infection anterior to the orbital septum).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Spreading redness and swelling beyond the eyelid (suggesting periorbital or orbital cellulitis), fever, vision changes, pain with eye movements, proptosis (bulging eye) - signs of orbital cellulitis, which is a medical emergency. Recurrent styes may warrant investigation for underlying conditions like diabetes or blepharitis.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: H00.01- (Hordeolum externum). H00.02- (Hordeolum internum). Specific codes for laterality.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Clinical diagnosis. Rarely needed unless there are signs of more widespread infection or systemic involvement.

### **77. Chalazion**

-   **Symptoms**: A non-infectious, chronic lump in the eyelid caused by a blockage of a meibomian gland (an oil gland in the eyelid). Presents as a firm, rubbery, typically painless lump in the eyelid. Develops gradually. May sometimes follow a stye. Can occasionally cause mild swelling or redness of the eyelid if inflamed, or blurred vision if large enough to press on the cornea.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age. More common in individuals with blepharitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis.
-   **Medications**: Management is often conservative initially, as some chalazia resolve on their own.
    *   **Conservative:** Warm compresses applied to the eyelid several times a day to help liquefy the blocked oil and promote drainage. Gentle massage of the eyelid.
    *   **Injections:** Corticosteroid injection into the chalazion can help reduce inflammation and shrink the lump.
    *   **Incision and Drainage:** Surgical incision and drainage of the chalazion may be necessary if it is large, persistent, affecting vision, or cosmetically bothersome.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Stye (hordeolum - acute, painful, often pointing), Sebaceous carcinoma (rare malignant tumor that can mimic a chalazion, especially if recurrent in the same location in older adults), Basal cell carcinoma, Cyst.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Recurrent chalazion in the same location, especially in older adults, should raise suspicion for sebaceous carcinoma and warrants biopsy. Lesion that is rapidly growing, irregular, or associated with loss of eyelashes. Signs of infection (redness, warmth, pain, fever) - consider a stye or cellulitis.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: H00.1- (Chalazion). Specific codes for laterality.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Clinical diagnosis. Biopsy is indicated for recurrent chalazia in the same location or any suspicious features to rule out sebaceous carcinoma.

### **78. Cerumen Impaction (Earwax)**

-   **Symptoms**: Accumulation of earwax (cerumen) in the ear canal that causes symptoms. Earwax is a natural substance that protects the ear canal. Symptoms of impaction can include muffled hearing or hearing loss, earache, feeling of fullness in the ear, itching in the ear, tinnitus (ringing in the ear), and sometimes dizziness or vertigo.
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages. More common in older adults. Risk factors include using cotton swabs or other objects to clean the ears (which can push wax deeper), wearing hearing aids or earplugs, narrow or abnormally shaped ear canals, and excessive hair in the ear canal.
-   **Medications**: Removal of the impacted earwax.
    *   **Earwax Softeners:** Over-the-counter ear drops (e.g., carbamide peroxide, mineral oil, glycerin) can help soften the wax, making it easier to remove. Used for several days.
    *   **Irrigation:** Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water or saline using a syringe after softening the wax.
    *   **Manual Removal:** Using specialized instruments (e.g., curettes, forceps) or suction to remove the wax, performed by a healthcare provider. Preferred in patients with a history of ear surgery, perforated eardrum, or ear tubes.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Other causes of hearing loss (e.g., middle ear fluid, infection, nerve damage), Otitis externa, Foreign body in the ear canal, TMJ dysfunction (can cause ear pain).

Most commonly caused by bacteria, often *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* or *Staphylococcus aureus*. Symptoms include ear pain (otalgia), which is often worse when pulling on the outer ear (pinna) or pressing on the tragus (the small flap in front of the ear canal). May also have itching in the ear, redness and swelling of the ear canal, discharge (clear initially, can become cloudy or pus-like), and sometimes muffled hearing due to swelling or debris in the canal. Fever is uncommon in uncomplicated cases.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age. Risk factors include swimming or spending time in water (hence "swimmer's ear" - moisture can break down the skin barrier in the canal), trauma to the ear canal (e.g., from cotton swabs, scratching), underlying skin conditions (e.g., eczema, seborrheic dermatitis), and diabetes or weakened immune system (increased risk of severe or complicated infection).
-   **Medications**: Topical ear drops are the mainstay of treatment.
    *   **Topical Antibiotic Ear Drops:** (e.g., quinolone drops like ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, polymyxin B-neomycin-hydrocortisone) are typically prescribed. Some drops also contain corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and pain.
    *   **Topical Antifungal Ear Drops:** If a fungal infection is suspected.
    *   **Pain Management:** Over-the-counter pain relievers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen).
    *   **Ear Canal Cleaning:** Debridement (cleaning out debris and discharge from the ear canal) by a healthcare provider is often helpful to allow the ear drops to penetrate the infected tissue.
    *   **Ear Wick:** If the ear canal is very swollen, a wick may be inserted to help deliver ear drops into the canal.
    *   **Oral Antibiotics:** Reserved for cases with spreading infection (cellulitis of the pinna or surrounding tissues), systemic symptoms (fever), or in immunocompromised patients.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Acute otitis media (AOM - infection of the middle ear, pain is not typically worsened by manipulating the outer ear), Foreign body in the ear canal, Furuncle (boil) in the ear canal, Contact dermatitis in the ear canal, Referred pain (e.g., from teeth, TMJ, throat). Malignant otitis externa (a rare, severe, invasive infection of the external auditory canal and surrounding bone, typically in elderly diabetic or immunocompromised patients - **medical emergency**).

    *   **Severe pain that is out of proportion to the clinical findings.**
    *   **Fever or systemic symptoms.**
    *   **Spreading redness and swelling beyond the ear canal to the pinna or surrounding tissues.**
    *   **Facial weakness, numbness, or other neurological symptoms:** Suggests involvement of cranial nerves, a sign of malignant otitis externa.
    *   **Severe headache.**
    *   **Symptoms in a patient with diabetes or weakened immune system:** Higher risk of malignant otitis externa.
    *   **Visualization of granulation tissue in the ear canal.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: H60.90 (Otitis externa, unspecified, unspecified ear). Specific codes exist for infectious otitis externa (H60.3-) and other forms, and laterality.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Clinical diagnosis based on otoscopic examination. Culture of ear discharge may be done in severe cases, treatment failure, or suspected malignant otitis externa. Imaging (CT scan) is needed for suspected malignant otitis externa to assess bone involvement.

They are usually round or oval with a white or yellowish center and a red border. Not contagious. Can be single or multiple. Minor aphthous ulcers are the most common type, small and heal within 1-2 weeks without scarring. Major aphthous ulcers are larger, deeper, and can take longer to heal, sometimes with scarring. Herpetiform aphthous ulcers are clusters of many small ulcers.
-   **Demographics**: Common, affects adolescents and young adults more frequently, but can occur at any age. The exact cause is unknown but triggers may include stress, minor injury to the mouth lining, certain foods (e.g., citrus fruits, spicy foods), nutritional deficiencies (e.g., B12, folate, iron, zinc), hormonal changes, and certain medical conditions (e.g., celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Behcet's disease).
