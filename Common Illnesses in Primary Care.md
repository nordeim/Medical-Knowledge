# Top 100 Common Illnesses in Primary Care

## Overview

Primary care serves as the cornerstone of healthcare systems, managing a vast spectrum of patient needs, from acute illnesses to chronic disease management and preventive care. General practitioners are often the first point of contact for patients, requiring broad knowledge and the ability to differentiate common, self-limiting conditions from those requiring urgent intervention or specialist referral. This document aims to provide a comprehensive reference for the top 100 common illnesses encountered in primary care, offering details on symptoms, affected demographics, typical medications, differential diagnoses, red-flag symptoms, ICD-10 codes, and relevant laboratory investigations. While this list is extensive, the practice of medicine is ever-evolving, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and the integration of new evidence and guidelines into clinical practice.

Based on available data, common reasons for primary care visits include upper respiratory tract infections, hypertension, routine health maintenance, arthritis, diabetes, depression or anxiety, pneumonia, acute otitis media, back pain, and dermatitis. Patient-reported reasons for visits often include symptomatic complaints such as cough, back pain, abdominal symptoms, pharyngitis, fever, headache, and fatigue. Chronic conditions account for a significant proportion of visits, particularly in older adults.

## Common Illnesses

Here is a detailed breakdown of common illnesses encountered in primary care, following the established structure:

---

### **1. Hypertension (Essential)**

-   **Symptoms**: Often asymptomatic, earning it the moniker "silent killer." When symptoms occur, they can include headaches (commonly in the back of the head upon waking), dizziness, visual changes (blurred or double vision), facial flushing, nosebleeds, and shortness of breath, especially with exertion. Severe hypertension may present with symptoms of a hypertensive crisis, such as a very severe headache, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or neurological deficits.
-   **Demographics**: Prevalence increases with age, particularly after 45. Males are more commonly affected than females before menopause, with rates becoming similar or higher in postmenopausal women. There is a higher prevalence and often greater severity in Black populations. Other risk factors include obesity, family history, high sodium intake, sedentary lifestyle, and excessive alcohol consumption.
-   **Medications**:
    *   **First-line (used alone or in combination):** Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone), ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril), Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) (e.g., losartan, valsartan), Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) (e.g., amlodipine, nifedipine).
    *   **Other commonly used:** Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, carvedilol - often for specific indications like post-myocardial infarction or heart failure), Alpha-blockers (e.g., prazosin, terazosin - can be useful with concomitant benign prostatic hyperplasia), Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone - for resistant hypertension or primary hyperaldosteronism). Medication choice is often guided by comorbidities, age, and race. Single-pill combination therapies are often recommended to improve adherence.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: It's crucial to consider secondary causes of hypertension, especially in younger patients, those with sudden onset or severe hypertension, or those whose blood pressure is difficult to control despite multiple medications. These include: Pheochromocytoma, Renal artery stenosis, Primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, Thyroid disorders (hypo- or hyperthyroidism), Coarctation of the aorta, Sleep apnea, and medication-induced hypertension (e.g., NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, decongestants).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Hypertensive Emergency:** Severe elevated blood pressure (typically >180/120 mmHg) accompanied by acute organ damage (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological deficits, acute kidney injury, visual changes). This requires immediate emergency treatment.
    *   **Hypertensive Urgency:** Severe elevated blood pressure (>180/120 mmHg) without evidence of acute organ damage. Requires prompt blood pressure reduction over hours to days.
    *   Symptoms suggestive of a secondary cause, such as sudden onset or worsening hypertension, young age of onset, resistant hypertension, palpitations, excessive sweating, muscle weakness, or signs of renal disease.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: I10 (Essential (primary) hypertension). More specific codes may apply for secondary hypertension or hypertensive complications.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Initial workup:** Basic metabolic panel (serum electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, glucose), Lipid panel, Urinalysis (for proteinuria or hematuria), Electrocardiogram (EKG) (to assess for left ventricular hypertrophy or signs of ischemic heart disease).
    *   **Further investigations (if secondary hypertension is suspected):** Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Uric acid, Calcium, potentially imaging (renal ultrasound, CT/MRI of adrenal glands), or specific hormonal assays.

---

### **2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**

-   **Symptoms**: Often insidious in onset and may be asymptomatic for a long time. Common symptoms include polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and recurrent infections (e.g., skin, urinary tract, yeast infections). Unintentional weight loss can occur, though it's more characteristic of Type 1 diabetes.
-   **Demographics**: Typically diagnosed in individuals over 45, though increasing rates are seen in younger populations, including children and adolescents, often linked to rising obesity rates. Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are major risk factors. Family history significantly increases risk. Higher incidence is noted in Hispanic, Black, Indigenous, and Asian populations.
-   **Medications**:
    *   **First-line:** Metformin is generally the initial medication of choice, particularly for overweight or obese individuals, due to its efficacy, safety profile, and potential cardiovascular benefits.
    *   **Other commonly used:** GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide), SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., empagliflozin, canagliflozin) - these classes are increasingly used earlier, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, due to demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits. DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin), Sulfonylureas (e.g., glyburide, glipizide), Thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone), and Insulin (when oral medications are insufficient to achieve glycemic targets or in specific clinical situations). Medication selection is highly individualized based on glycemic control, comorbidities, risk of hypoglycemia, weight effects, and cost.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (usually presents acutely with more severe symptoms, often in younger individuals), Secondary diabetes (e.g., Cushing's syndrome, Hemochromatosis, Pancreatitis, certain medications like corticosteroids), Impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose (pre-diabetes).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: Unintentional and significant weight loss, particularly if rapid; polyuria that is particularly noticeable at night (nocturia); frequent or severe infections; symptoms of hyperglycemia (severe thirst, frequent urination, high blood sugar readings) or impending diabetic ketoacidosis (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rapid breathing, fruity breath odor - more common in Type 1 but can occur in Type 2 under stress or severe illness); symptoms of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (severe dehydration, confusion, high blood sugar without significant ketosis).
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications). More specific codes exist for diabetes with complications (e.g., renal, neurological, ophthalmic) or if insulin dependent.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Fasting plasma glucose, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (reflects average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months), Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (less commonly used in routine primary care but can be helpful for diagnosis or in pregnancy), Urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio (to screen for diabetic kidney disease), Lipid panel (diabetes is a significant risk factor for dyslipidemia), Basic metabolic panel (to assess renal function and electrolytes).

### **3. Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)**

-   **Symptoms**: A constellation of symptoms affecting the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Common symptoms include sore throat, rhinorrhea (runny nose), nasal congestion, cough (initially dry, can become productive), low-grade fever (more common in children), sneezing, malaise, mild headache, and myalgias. Symptoms typically peak within a few days and gradually resolve.
-   **Demographics**: Affects all age groups, but incidence is higher in children and the elderly. Often has seasonal variation, with increased prevalence during fall and winter months. Transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and direct contact.
-   **Medications**: Treatment is primarily symptomatic as most URTIs are viral.
    *   **Symptomatic Relief:** Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain. Decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine) for nasal congestion (use with caution in patients with hypertension or heart disease). Antihistamines for rhinorrhea and sneezing. Cough suppressants (for dry cough) or expectorants (for productive cough) may be used, although evidence for their efficacy can be mixed. Nasal saline sprays can help with congestion.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Avoided unless there is strong suspicion of a bacterial superinfection (e.g., bacterial sinusitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia). Most URTIs are viral and do not respond to antibiotics.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Influenza (often presents with more abrupt onset, higher fever, and more severe myalgias), Streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat - bacterial infection with characteristic tonsillar exudates, fever, and absence of cough), Allergic rhinitis (chronic or seasonal symptoms triggered by allergens, often with itching, sneezing, and watery eyes, typically without fever), Sinusitis (bacterial sinusitis should be considered if symptoms, particularly nasal discharge and cough, persist for over 10-14 days or worsen after initial improvement, especially with facial pain or high fever), Bronchitis, Pneumonia (lower respiratory tract infection, usually with higher fever, significant cough with sputum, shortness of breath, and often abnormal chest X-ray), Mononucleosis, COVID-19.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Dyspnea (shortness of breath) or difficulty breathing:** May indicate pneumonia or other lower respiratory tract involvement.
    *   **Stridor (high-pitched whistling sound during breathing) or drooling:** Can be signs of epiglottitis or peritonsillar abscess, which are medical emergencies.
    *   **Persistent high fever (>5 days):** May suggest a bacterial infection like pneumonia or sinusitis.
    *   **Neck stiffness or severe headache with fever:** Could indicate meningitis.
    *   **Hemoptysis (coughing up blood):** Requires investigation to rule out more serious conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J06.9 (Acute upper respiratory infection, unspecified). More specific codes exist for infections of specific sites (e.g., rhinitis, pharyngitis).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history and physical examination. Laboratory tests are generally not required for uncomplicated URTIs.
    *   **May be considered if differential diagnoses are suspected:** Rapid strep test or throat culture (for suspected streptococcal pharyngitis), Influenza swab or rapid influenza diagnostic test (if influenza is suspected, especially during flu season), Chest X-ray (if pneumonia is suspected based on symptoms and examination).

---

### **4. Major Depressive Disorder**

-   **Symptoms**: Persistent sad, empty, or irritable mood, often accompanied by anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in activities previously enjoyed). Other symptoms include significant changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia), fatigue or low energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, difficulty concentrating, indecisiveness, restlessness or slowed movements, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Symptoms must be present for at least two weeks and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning.
-   **Demographics**: Can affect individuals of any age, but the peak age of onset is typically between 25 and 49. More commonly diagnosed in females than males, with a ratio of approximately 2:1.
-   **Medications**:
    *   **First-line:** Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., sertraline, fluoxetine, escitalopram) are commonly the initial choice due to their efficacy and generally favorable side effect profile.
    *   **Other commonly used:** Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine), Atypical antidepressants (e.g., bupropion, mirtazapine), Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (less commonly used first-line due to side effects but can be effective), Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) (less commonly used, often for refractory depression, require dietary restrictions).
    *   **Adjunctive Therapy:** Psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)) is a crucial component of treatment, often used in conjunction with medication.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Bipolar disorder (characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania in addition to depressive episodes), Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia - chronic low-grade depression), Adjustment disorder with depressed mood (in response to a specific stressor), Hypothyroidism (can cause symptoms mimicking depression), Anemia (can cause fatigue and low energy), Chronic fatigue syndrome, Grief reactions, Substance abuse, other medical conditions (e.g., neurological disorders, vitamin deficiencies).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Suicidal ideation or behavior:** Any mention of wanting to harm oneself requires immediate assessment and appropriate safety measures, potentially including urgent psychiatric referral or hospitalization.
    *   **Psychosis:** Presence of hallucinations or delusions (e.g., nihilistic delusions, delusions of guilt) in the context of depression indicates severe depression and necessitates urgent psychiatric evaluation.
    *   **Self-harm:** Evidence of self-injurious behavior requires immediate attention and assessment of suicidal risk.
    *   **Unexplained significant weight loss or severe fatigue:** While symptoms of depression, these can also be red flags for underlying organic causes or malignancy.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of bipolar disorder:** History of manic or hypomanic episodes.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified). More specific codes exist for single or recurrent episodes and specifiers regarding severity (mild, moderate, severe) and features (with psychotic features, melancholic features, atypical features).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on psychiatric history and mental status examination. Laboratory tests are mainly used to rule out other conditions that can mimic depression.
    *   **Common tests to consider:** Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (to rule out hypothyroidism), Complete Blood Count (CBC) (to check for anemia), Vitamin D levels, Vitamin B12 levels, Folate levels, potentially toxicology screen if substance use is suspected.

### **5. Osteoarthritis**

-   **Symptoms**: Characterized by joint pain that typically worsens with activity and is relieved by rest. Other symptoms include joint stiffness (especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity, usually lasting less than 30 minutes), crepitus (a grating or crackling sound or sensation in the joint with movement), limited range of motion, and occasional joint swelling, particularly during flares. Commonly affected joints include knees, hips, hands (DIP and PIP joints, base of thumb), spine, and feet.
-   **Demographics**: The most common form of arthritis, with prevalence increasing significantly with age, particularly after 60. More common in postmenopausal women than men. Other risk factors include obesity, previous joint injury or trauma, overuse of joints (e.g., in certain occupations or sports), and a genetic predisposition.
-   **Medications**: Management is often multimodal, including non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches.
    *   **Non-pharmacological:** Weight loss (especially for knee and hip OA), exercise (range of motion, strengthening, aerobic), physical therapy, occupational therapy, heat and cold therapy, bracing or assistive devices.
    *   **Pharmacological (for pain relief):** Acetaminophen is often recommended as a first-line oral analgesic for mild to moderate pain. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib) are effective for pain and inflammation, used orally or topically. Topical NSAIDs may be preferred for localized OA, particularly in the knees and hands, due to lower systemic side effect risk. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections can provide short-term pain relief for moderate to severe joint pain. Other options include duloxetine (an SNRI also indicated for chronic musculoskeletal pain) and tramadol. Opioids are generally avoided due to risks.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Rheumatoid arthritis (inflammatory arthritis with symmetrical joint involvement, prominent morning stiffness lasting over an hour, and systemic symptoms), Gout (acute inflammatory arthritis typically affecting a single joint, often the base of the big toe, with severe pain, swelling, redness, and warmth), Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, similar to gout but with different crystal composition), Septic arthritis (bacterial infection of a joint, presenting with acute onset of severe pain, swelling, redness, warmth, and often fever and systemic symptoms), Fibromyalgia (widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in specific points), Bursitis, Tendinitis, Seronegative spondyloarthropathies.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Acute onset of severe joint pain with marked swelling, warmth, and erythema (redness):** Highly suggestive of septic arthritis (a medical emergency) or acute gout.
    *   **Fever or systemic toxicity accompanying joint symptoms:** Raises suspicion for septic arthritis or other systemic inflammatory conditions.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss or fever in the setting of joint pain:** Could indicate malignancy or infection.
    *   Rapidly progressive joint destruction or deformity (can occur in severe OA but also in other conditions like septic arthritis or certain inflammatory arthropathies).
-   **ICD-10 Code**: M19.90 (Osteoarthritis, unspecified site). More specific codes exist for osteoarthritis of specific joints (e.g., knee, hip, hand).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history, physical examination, and characteristic radiographic findings (joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, cysts).
    *   **Laboratory tests are often used to rule out other conditions:** Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (usually normal in uncomplicated OA but elevated in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or septic arthritis), Synovial fluid analysis (if joint effusion is present, to rule out infection or crystal-induced arthritis - involves aspirating fluid from the joint for cell count, crystal analysis, and culture). Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies (for suspected rheumatoid arthritis). Serum uric acid (for suspected gout, although normal levels do not rule out acute gout).

### **6. Rheumatoid Arthritis**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the synovium (joint lining). Classic presentation includes symmetrical joint pain and swelling, most commonly affecting the small joints of the hands (PIP and MCP joints) and feet, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees. A hallmark symptom is morning stiffness lasting for more than one hour. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue, low-grade fever, malaise, and unintended weight loss are also common. Over time, can lead to joint damage and deformity. Extra-articular manifestations can affect organs like the skin (rheumatoid nodules), eyes, lungs, heart, and blood vessels.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age, but onset is most common between 30 and 60 years. More prevalent in females than males, with a ratio of approximately 3:1. Genetic predisposition (e.g., presence of HLA-DRB1 alleles) and environmental factors (e.g., smoking) play a role.
-   **Medications**: Treatment aims to reduce inflammation, alleviate symptoms, prevent joint damage, and improve function. Early and aggressive treatment is often recommended.
    *   **Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs):** Methotrexate is often the first-line conventional synthetic DMARD. Other conventional DMARDs include sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine.
    *   **Biologic DMARDs:** (e.g., etanercept, adalimumab, rituximab, abatacept) are used when conventional DMARDs are insufficient or in patients with moderate to severe disease. These target specific components of the immune system.
    *   **Targeted Synthetic DMARDs:** (e.g., tofacitinib, baricitinib) are oral medications that target specific intracellular pathways.
    *   **Symptomatic Relief:** NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) are used to reduce pain and inflammation but do not alter disease progression. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) can be used for short periods during flares or as a bridge therapy when initiating DMARDs, but long-term use is limited by side effects.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Osteoarthritis (typically affects different joints, morning stiffness is shorter, less systemic symptoms), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE - another autoimmune disease that can cause joint pain but also affects multiple organ systems, often with characteristic rashes, photosensitivity, and hematological abnormalities), Psoriatic arthritis (inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, can affect joints asymmetrically or symmetrically, can involve the spine and entheses), Gout, Pseudogout, Reactive arthritis, Viral arthritis, Polymyalgia rheumatica (inflammatory condition causing muscle pain and stiffness, primarily in the shoulders and hips, in older adults).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Rapidly progressive joint pain, swelling, and loss of function:** While RA is chronic, a sudden worsening could indicate a flare or superimposed infection (septic arthritis).
    *   **Signs of extra-articular involvement impacting organ function:** Shortness of breath (interstitial lung disease), chest pain (pericarditis, increased cardiovascular risk), severe eye pain or vision changes (scleritis, uveitis), symptoms of vasculitis (skin ulcers, nerve damage).
    *   **Unexplained weight loss or persistent fever:** Can be symptoms of active RA but also warrant investigation for infection or malignancy.
    *   **Severe joint deformities developing rapidly.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: M06.9 (Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified). More specific codes exist based on the presence of rheumatoid factor and affected sites.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Key diagnostic tests:** Rheumatoid Factor (RF) (positive in about 80% of patients, but can be positive in other conditions and negative in early RA), Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies (more specific for RA than RF and can be positive early in the disease), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (markers of inflammation, typically elevated in active RA).
    *   **Other relevant tests:** Complete Blood Count (CBC) (may show anemia of chronic disease or thrombocytosis), Liver and renal function tests (important before starting certain DMARDs and for monitoring), Imaging studies (X-rays of affected joints to assess for joint damage, erosion, and joint space narrowing).

---

### **7. Migraine**

-   **Symptoms**: A type of headache characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate to severe, often unilateral, pulsating or throbbing head pain. Typically aggravated by physical activity. Often accompanied by associated symptoms such as nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). Some individuals experience an aura before the headache, which can involve visual disturbances (flashing lights, blind spots), sensory changes (numbness, tingling), or speech difficulties. Attacks can last from a few hours to several days.
-   **Demographics**: Most common between the ages of 18 and 44. More prevalent in females than males, with a ratio of approximately 3:1. Family history is a strong risk factor.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves both acute (abortive) treatment for individual attacks and prophylactic (preventive) treatment for frequent or severe migraines.
    *   **Acute Treatment:** Over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen) for mild to moderate migraines. Triptans (e.g., sumatriptan, zolmitriptan) are serotonin receptor agonists effective for moderate to severe migraines. Ditans (e.g., lasmiditan) and Gepants (e.g., ubrogepant, rimegepant) are newer classes for acute treatment. Anti-emetics (e.g., metoclopramide, ondansetron) to treat nausea and vomiting. Combination analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine).
    *   **Prophylactic Treatment (for frequent or debilitating migraines):** Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, metoprolol), Anticonvulsants (e.g., topiramate, valproic acid), CGRP inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies like erenumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab, and oral gepants like atogepant), Calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil), Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Tension-type headache (most common type, typically bilateral, non-pulsating, mild to moderate pain, not aggravated by activity, usually without nausea or vomiting, though photophobia or phonophobia can be present), Cluster headache (severe, strictly unilateral pain, often around the eye, occurring in clusters, associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms like nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, ptosis), Secondary headaches (headaches caused by underlying conditions, which must be ruled out, especially if the headache is sudden, severe, or associated with neurological symptoms).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Thunderclap headache:** A sudden, severe headache that reaches maximum intensity within seconds to minutes. This is a medical emergency and could indicate a subarachnoid hemorrhage or other serious intracranial pathology.
    *   **Headache with focal neurological deficits:** New onset of weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, visual loss, or other neurological symptoms that persist beyond the headache duration or occur without a typical migraine aura. Could indicate stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a structural brain lesion.
    *   **Headache with fever, neck stiffness, or rash:** Suggests meningitis or encephalitis.
    *   **Headache that is new or different in a patient with a history of cancer or immunocompromise.**
    *   **Headache that worsens with coughing, straining, or changes in position.**
    *   **Headache with papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve head):** Suggests increased intracranial pressure.
    *   **New onset headache in a patient over 50 years old, especially if associated with scalp tenderness or jaw claudication:** Could indicate giant cell arteritis, which requires urgent evaluation and treatment to prevent vision loss.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: G43.909 (Migraine, unspecified, not intractable, without status migrainosus or not otherwise classified). More specific codes exist based on the presence or absence of aura, intractability, and status migrainosus.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Neuroimaging (CT or MRI of the head) is not usually necessary for typical migraines but is indicated if red-flag symptoms are present or if the headache presentation is atypical.
    *   **May consider:** ESR (if giant cell arteritis is suspected in older patients).

---

### **8. Epilepsy**

-   **Symptoms**: Characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Seizures are transient occurrences of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Seizure types vary widely depending on the area of the brain affected and can include:
    *   **Focal seizures:** Originating in one area of the brain. Symptoms depend on the location and can include motor (jerking movements), sensory (unusual smells or tastes, tingling), autonomic (changes in heart rate, blood pressure), or cognitive (déjà vu, confusion) phenomena. Consciousness may be preserved or impaired.
    *   **Generalized seizures:** Involving widespread areas of the brain. Types include tonic-clonic (formerly grand mal - loss of consciousness, body stiffening, and rhythmic jerking), absence (formerly petit mal - brief愣神 spells, common in children), tonic (muscle stiffening), atonic (sudden loss of muscle tone), myoclonic (brief muscle jerks).
    *   **Post-ictal phase:** Period following a seizure, which can include confusion, drowsiness, headache, or focal weakness.
-   **Demographics**: Can begin at any age, with peaks in incidence in early childhood and in older adults. Causes vary with age (e.g., genetic or developmental in children, stroke or neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly).
-   **Medications**: Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs), also known as antiseizure medications, are the primary treatment to prevent seizures. The choice of AED depends on the seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, potential side effects, comorbidities, age, and gender (e.g., considerations for women of childbearing potential).
    *   **Commonly prescribed AEDs:** Levetiracetam, Lamotrigine, Valproic acid, Carbamazepine, Oxcarbazepine, Phenytoin, Topiramate, Gabapentin, Pregabalin. Newer AEDs are also available and often used for specific seizure types or when older medications are not tolerated.
    *   **Other treatments:** Vagal nerve stimulation, ketogenic diet, and epilepsy surgery may be options for some individuals with refractory epilepsy.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Syncope (fainting - transient loss of consciousness due to reduced blood flow to the brain, often triggered by specific events like standing up quickly, fear, or pain; usually shorter duration than seizures and lacks the typical motor manifestations of generalized seizures), Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES - events that resemble epileptic seizures but are psychological in origin), Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar can cause confusion, shaking, and even loss of consciousness), Cardiac arrhythmias (can cause syncope or near-syncope), Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA - "mini-stroke" can cause transient neurological symptoms), Migraine with aura (especially complex auras), Sleep disorders (e.g., narcolepsy, sleep apnea), Movement disorders, Vertigo.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Status epilepticus:** A medical emergency defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness between them. Requires immediate medical intervention to prevent brain damage.
    *   **New-onset seizures in adults, particularly those over 50 years old:** While epilepsy can begin at any age, new onset in this age group warrants investigation to rule out underlying structural brain lesions (e.g., tumor, stroke) or metabolic causes.
    *   **Seizures associated with focal neurological deficits that persist after the seizure.**
    *   **Headache, fever, or neck stiffness accompanying seizures:** Suggests central nervous system infection (meningitis, encephalitis).
    *   **History of head trauma, stroke, or brain tumor.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: G40.909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus). More specific codes exist for different seizure types and epilepsy syndromes, as well as intractability and status epilepticus.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** Records electrical activity in the brain and can help identify abnormal seizure patterns and classify epilepsy syndromes.
    *   **Neuroimaging (MRI of the brain is preferred):** To identify structural causes of seizures such as tumors, stroke lesions, malformations, or evidence of previous injury.
    *   **Laboratory blood tests:** Serum glucose (to rule out hypoglycemia), Electrolytes (imbalances can trigger seizures), Calcium, Magnesium, Renal and liver function tests (baseline before starting AEDs and for monitoring), Toxicology screen (to rule out substance use or withdrawal). Lumbar puncture may be necessary if CNS infection is suspected.

### **9. Hypothyroidism**

-   **Symptoms**: Caused by insufficient production of thyroid hormones. Symptoms are often non-specific and develop gradually. Common symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, brittle nails, muscle aches and weakness, joint pain, slowed heart rate (bradycardia), depression, impaired memory and concentration ("brain fog"), and menstrual irregularities in women. Severe, long-standing hypothyroidism can lead to myxedema, characterized by puffiness of the face and hands, thickening of the skin, and deepening of the voice.
-   **Demographics**: More common in females than males and prevalence increases with age, particularly over 60. Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) is the most common cause in iodine-sufficient areas. Other causes include iodine deficiency (more common globally), thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, certain medications (e.g., amiodarone, lithium), and central hypothyroidism (problems with the pituitary or hypothalamus).
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
    *   **First-line:** Levothyroxine (synthetic T4) is the standard treatment. The dose is individualized and adjusted based on TSH levels.
    *   Other preparations, such as liothyronine (synthetic T3) or combination therapy (T4 and T3), are used less commonly and in specific circumstances.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Depression (many overlapping symptoms, but hypothyroidism should be ruled out in patients presenting with depressive symptoms), Anemia (can cause fatigue and pallor), Chronic fatigue syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Menopause (in women, symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and mood changes can overlap), Medication side effects.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Myxedema coma:** A rare but life-threatening complication of severe, untreated hypothyroidism, characterized by severe hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoventilation, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and altered mental status or coma. Requires immediate intensive care.
    *   **Rapidly enlarging goiter or associated compressive symptoms (difficulty swallowing or breathing, hoarseness):** Could indicate thyroid malignancy or a rapidly growing benign goiter requiring assessment.
    *   Symptoms of associated autoimmune conditions (e.g., adrenal insufficiency - rare but life-threatening if missed in the context of autoimmune hypothyroidism).
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E03.9 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different causes of hypothyroidism (e.g., autoimmune thyroiditis, post-surgical hypothyroidism).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH):** The most sensitive initial test for primary hypothyroidism. An elevated TSH indicates that the pituitary gland is trying to stimulate a sluggish thyroid.
    *   **Free Thyroxine (Free T4):** Measures the amount of active thyroid hormone in the blood. Typically low in overt hypothyroidism.
    *   **Thyroid antibodies (e.g., anti-TPO antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies):** Can help identify autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) as the cause.
    *   **Other tests to consider based on symptoms or differential diagnoses:** Complete Blood Count (CBC), Lipid panel (hypothyroidism can cause hyperlipidemia), Basic metabolic panel.

### **10. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**

-   **Symptoms**: A common endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women characterized by a combination of signs and symptoms related to hormonal imbalance and metabolic dysfunction. Key features include menstrual irregularities (oligomenorrhea - infrequent periods, or amenorrhea - absence of periods), hyperandrogenism (excess levels of male hormones, leading to symptoms like hirsutism - excessive hair growth, acne, and sometimes male-pattern baldness), and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries containing multiple small follicles). Patients may also experience weight gain, difficulty losing weight, and insulin resistance.
-   **Demographics**: Affects reproductive-age females, typically diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood. Exact prevalence varies but is estimated to affect 5-10% of women in this age group. Often has a genetic component and can run in families. Obesity is common in women with PCOS and can worsen symptoms, but PCOS can also occur in lean individuals.
-   **Medications**: Management is tailored to the individual's primary concerns (e.g., menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, infertility, metabolic issues).
    *   **First-line for menstrual irregularities and hirsutism:** Combined oral contraceptives help regulate periods and reduce androgen levels.
    *   **For insulin resistance and often used for menstrual regulation and improving fertility:** Metformin can improve insulin sensitivity, help regulate menstrual cycles, and may contribute to modest weight loss.
    *   **For hirsutism:** Anti-androgen medications (e.g., spironolactone) can be used, often in combination with oral contraceptives.
    *   **For infertility:** Clomiphene citrate or letrozole to induce ovulation; sometimes gonadotropins or IVF.
    *   **Lifestyle modifications:** Weight loss (even modest weight loss can significantly improve symptoms and metabolic parameters), healthy diet, and regular exercise are crucial.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Thyroid dysfunction (hypo- or hyperthyroidism can cause menstrual irregularities), Hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin levels can cause menstrual irregularities and galactorrhea), Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (late-onset forms can mimic PCOS with hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularities), Cushing's syndrome (rare, but can cause weight gain, menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and striae), Androgen-secreting tumors (rare, but should be considered in cases of rapid onset or severe hyperandrogenism), Primary ovarian insufficiency, Hypothalamic amenorrhea.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Rapid onset of severe hirsutism or other signs of virilization (e.g., deepening voice, increased muscle mass, clitoral enlargement):** Could indicate a more serious underlying cause of hyperandrogenism, such as an androgen-secreting tumor.
    *   **Rapid weight gain, central obesity, easy bruising, wide purple striae, and proximal muscle weakness:** Suggestive of Cushing's syndrome.
    *   **Presence of a pelvic mass on examination or imaging:** While polycystic ovaries are characteristic, a large or suspicious ovarian mass requires further investigation to rule out ovarian tumors.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: E28.2 (Polycystic ovary syndrome).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Diagnosis is based on clinical features, hormonal assays, and ultrasound findings (Rotterdam criteria are commonly used).
    *   **Hormonal assays:** Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (LH/FSH ratio may be elevated in PCOS, but this is not always present), Total and free testosterone (elevated in hyperandrogenism), Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) (another androgen that can be elevated), Prolactin (to rule out hyperprolactinemia), TSH (to rule out thyroid dysfunction).
    *   **Metabolic screening:** Fasting glucose and HbA1c (to screen for impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes), Lipid panel (dyslipidemia is common in PCOS).
    *   **Imaging:** Pelvic ultrasound to assess ovarian morphology (presence of multiple small follicles). Endometrial thickness may also be assessed if there is prolonged amenorrhea to evaluate for endometrial hyperplasia.

### **11. Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition characterized by intense pruritus (itching), erythematous (red) patches and plaques, scaling, and sometimes vesicles or oozing. The appearance and distribution vary with age. In infants, it often presents on the face, scalp, and extensor surfaces of limbs. In children and adults, it typically affects the flexural areas (antecubital and popliteal fossae), neck, wrists, and ankles. The skin is often dry and sensitive. Scratching can lead to lichenification (thickening of the skin) and excoriations.
-   **Demographics**: Most commonly begins in infancy or early childhood, often improving with age, but can persist into adulthood or begin in adulthood. Frequently associated with a personal or family history of atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergies). More common in urban areas and developed countries.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on reducing inflammation, alleviating itching, repairing the skin barrier, and preventing flares.
    *   **Topical therapy:** Emollients and moisturizers are fundamental for all patients to hydrate the skin and improve barrier function. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay for reducing inflammation during flares, used in varying potencies depending on the severity and location. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) are alternative anti-inflammatory agents, particularly useful for sensitive areas like the face and eyelids, and for maintenance therapy.
    *   **Systemic therapy (for severe or refractory eczema):** Phototherapy (UV light therapy), Systemic corticosteroids (for severe flares, but long-term use is avoided), Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine), Biologics (e.g., dupilumab - targets IL-4 and IL-13, key cytokines in atopic inflammation).
    *   **Other:** Antihistamines (for itching, particularly sedating ones at night), Antibiotics (if secondary bacterial infection is suspected).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Contact dermatitis (allergic or irritant - localized reaction to a substance, often with a clear border), Psoriasis (sharply demarcated erythematous plaques with thick silvery scale, typically on extensor surfaces, scalp, and nails), Seborrheic dermatitis (scaling and redness in areas with high sebaceous gland activity like the scalp, face, and chest), Scabies (intensely itchy rash, often with burrows, particularly in intertriginous areas, highly contagious), Fungal infections (e.g., tinea corporis - ringworm, typically with annular lesions), Ichthyosis (genetic disorders causing dry, scaly skin), Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (rare, can mimic eczema-like patches).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Erythroderma:** Widespread redness and scaling covering most of the body surface, often with systemic symptoms like fever, chills, and malaise. Can be a severe exacerbation of eczema or indicate another serious skin condition or systemic illness.
    *   **Signs of secondary bacterial infection (impetiginization):** Golden-yellow crusts, pus, increasing pain, fever. Commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
    *   **Signs of viral infection (Eczema herpeticum):** Numerous monomorphic vesicles or punched-out erosions in the areas of eczema, often with pain, fever, and malaise. Caused by Herpes Simplex Virus and is a medical emergency.
    *   **Failure to respond to appropriate therapy or atypical presentation:** May warrant further investigation or biopsy to rule out other diagnoses.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: L20.9 (Atopic dermatitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different types of dermatitis and affected sites.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis.
    *   **May be considered in atypical cases or to identify triggers/complications:** Skin scraping or fungal culture (to rule out fungal infection), Bacterial culture (if secondary bacterial infection is suspected), Patch testing (if allergic contact dermatitis is suspected as a trigger or co-factor), Serum IgE levels and allergy testing (skin prick testing or specific IgE blood tests - may help identify aeroallergens or food allergens that can exacerbate eczema, particularly in severe cases or when allergic triggers are suspected).

### **12. Psoriasis**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the skin, characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with thick silvery scales. Commonly affects the elbows, knees, scalp, lower back, and nails. Psoriatic arthritis, an inflammatory arthritis affecting joints, occurs in a significant percentage of patients with psoriasis and can cause joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Other subtypes of psoriasis exist, including guttate (small, drop-like lesions), inverse (in skin folds), pustular (pus-filled blisters), and erythrodermic (widespread redness and scaling). Psoriasis is also associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age but has two peaks of onset: one between 15 and 35 years and a second in the late 50s or early 60s. Affects males and females equally. There is a strong genetic predisposition.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the severity and extent of the disease, as well as the presence of psoriatic arthritis.
    *   **Topical therapy (for mild to moderate disease):** Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay, used in varying potencies. Vitamin D analogs (e.g., calcipotriene), Topical retinoids (e.g., tazarotene), Coal tar, Anthralin, Calcineurin inhibitors (for sensitive areas).
    *   **Phototherapy (for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis):** UVB or PUVA (psoralen plus UVA light).
    *   **Systemic therapy (for moderate to severe disease or psoriatic arthritis):** Methotrexate, Cyclosporine, Acitretin (a retinoid).
    *   **Biologics (for moderate to severe disease or psoriatic arthritis unresponsive to conventional therapy):** Target specific cytokines or immune cells involved in psoriasis pathogenesis (e.g., TNF-alpha inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors, IL-23 inhibitors).
    *   **Targeted Synthetic DMARDs (for psoriatic arthritis):** (e.g., tofacitinib, apremilast).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Seborrheic dermatitis (scaling and redness in seborrheic areas, less well-demarcated than psoriasis), Eczema (itchy, less well-demarcated, typically in flexural areas), Lichen planus (itchy, purple, polygonal papules and plaques, can affect skin, mouth, nails, and genitals), Pityriasis rosea (acute eruption of oval, scaly patches, often preceded by a "herald patch"), Fungal infections (e.g., tinea corporis), Secondary syphilis (can present with a rash that mimics psoriasis), Drug eruptions.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Pustular psoriasis:** A severe, rare form characterized by widespread pustules, often with fever and systemic symptoms. Can be generalized (Von Zumbusch) or localized (palms and soles). Requires urgent medical attention.
    *   **Erythrodermic psoriasis:** Widespread redness and scaling covering most of the body surface, often with systemic symptoms. Can be life-threatening due to fluid and electrolyte imbalances and temperature dysregulation.
    *   **Arthritis mutilans:** A severe, deforming form of psoriatic arthritis that can lead to significant joint damage and shortening of digits. Requires aggressive management.
    *   **New onset or worsening joint pain in a patient with psoriasis:** Suggests development or flare of psoriatic arthritis.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss or fever:** While systemic inflammation can occur in severe psoriasis, these symptoms warrant investigation for infection or malignancy.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: L40.9 (Psoriasis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different types of psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Skin biopsy can be performed in atypical cases to confirm the diagnosis.
    *   **If psoriatic arthritis is suspected:** Rheumatoid factor (typically negative in psoriatic arthritis, which is why it's a seronegative spondyloarthropathy), ESR and CRP (may be elevated in active arthritis), Imaging (X-rays of affected joints to assess for characteristic changes of psoriatic arthritis).

---

### **13. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**

-   **Symptoms**: An age-related non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland, which can cause bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Symptoms are typically obstructive and irritative.
    *   **Obstructive symptoms:** Weak or slow urinary stream, difficulty initiating urination (hesitancy), straining to urinate, intermittent stream, feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, post-void dribbling.
    *   **Irritative symptoms:** Increased urinary frequency, urgency (a sudden strong urge to urinate), nocturia (waking up at night to urinate).
-   **Demographics**: Very common in aging men, with prevalence increasing significantly after age 50. The risk increases with age.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the presence of complications.
    *   **Lifestyle modifications:** Reducing fluid intake before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, particularly in the evening, timely voiding.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   **Alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin):** Relax the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow. Often provide rapid symptom relief.
        *   **5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride):** Block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is involved in prostate growth. These medications shrink the prostate gland and are more effective in men with larger prostates. They take longer to work than alpha-blockers (several months).
        *   **Combination therapy:** Combining an alpha-blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor may be more effective for some men with larger prostates and more severe symptoms.
        *   Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors (e.g., tadalafil) may also be used to treat BPH symptoms, particularly in men with concomitant erectile dysfunction.
    *   **Surgical interventions:** (e.g., Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), laser surgery) may be necessary for men with severe symptoms, complications, or those who do not respond to medical therapy.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Prostate cancer (can cause similar LUTS, though often asymptomatic in early stages), Urinary tract infection (UTI - can cause irritative symptoms like frequency and urgency, often with dysuria and sometimes hematuria), Neurogenic bladder (bladder dysfunction due to neurological conditions like stroke, spinal cord injury, or multiple sclerosis), Urethral stricture, Bladder stones, Overactive bladder (primarily urgency and frequency, often without significant obstructive symptoms).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Hematuria (blood in the urine):** While BPH can sometimes cause microscopic hematuria, gross hematuria (visible blood) or persistent microscopic hematuria warrants investigation to rule out malignancy (prostate, bladder, kidney cancer) or stones.
    *   **Acute urinary retention:** Inability to void, causing significant discomfort and bladder distension. Requires urgent catheterization.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of prostate cancer metastasis:** Bone pain (especially in the back, hips, or pelvis), unexplained weight loss.
    *   **Renal insufficiency or hydronephrosis on imaging:** Can occur in severe, long-standing BPH due to urinary obstruction.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: N40.1 (Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms). More specific codes exist for BPH without LUTS or with other complications.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA):** A blood test that can be elevated in BPH, but also in prostate cancer, prostatitis, and other conditions. Used in conjunction with digital rectal examination (DRE) to screen for prostate cancer. Shared decision-making with patients regarding PSA screening is important.
    *   **Urinalysis and urine culture:** To rule out urinary tract infection or hematuria.
    *   **Renal function tests (serum creatinine, BUN):** To assess for kidney impairment due to potential chronic obstruction.
    *   **Other tests:** Post-void residual volume (ultrasound or catheterization to measure the amount of urine left in the bladder after voiding - elevated in significant obstruction), Uroflowmetry (measures the speed and force of the urine stream).

### **14. Breast Cancer Screening**

-   **Symptoms**: Breast cancer in its early stages may be asymptomatic and detected through screening. When symptoms are present, they can include: a new lump or mass in the breast or armpit (often painless, firm, and irregular), changes in the size or shape of the breast, skin changes (dimpling, puckering, redness, scaling), nipple changes (inversion, discharge - especially if bloody or unilateral, redness, scaling), and breast pain (less common symptom).
-   **Demographics**: Primarily affects females, with risk increasing with age, particularly after 40. Family history of breast cancer (especially in a first-degree relative), certain genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1 and BRCA2), personal history of certain benign breast conditions, early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity or first full-term pregnancy after age 30, never breastfeeding, obesity, alcohol consumption, and hormone replacement therapy are risk factors. Can also occur in males, though much less common.
-   **Medications/Interventions**: Screening involves modalities to detect breast cancer before symptoms develop. Preventive medications may be used in high-risk individuals.
    *   **Screening:** Mammography is the primary screening tool for average-risk women, typically starting at age 40 or 50, with varying recommendations on frequency (annual or biennial) depending on guidelines and individual risk factors. Breast ultrasound and breast MRI may be used in addition to mammography in certain high-risk individuals (e.g., those with BRCA mutations, strong family history, or dense breast tissue). Clinical breast examination and breast self-examination are also components of breast health awareness.
    *   **Preventive Medications (for high-risk individuals):** Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) (e.g., tamoxifen, raloxifene) or aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole, exemestane) may be prescribed to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women at high risk.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Fibroadenoma (common benign solid breast tumor, often smooth, mobile, and rubbery), Breast cyst (fluid-filled sac, often feels smooth and movable, can be tender), Mastitis (inflammation of the breast tissue, often due to infection, causing pain, redness, swelling, and warmth, often associated with breastfeeding), Breast abscess (a localized collection of pus), Fat necrosis (lump formed by damaged fatty tissue), Sclerosing adenosis (benign proliferative lesion).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **A new, fixed, irregular, and painless lump or mass in the breast or axilla:** While not all cancers are painless or irregular, these features raise a high suspicion for malignancy.
    *   **Unilateral, spontaneous, bloody, or clear nipple discharge:** Can be a sign of underlying malignancy or papilloma.
    *   **Skin changes suggestive of inflammatory breast cancer:** Redness, warmth, swelling, and a pitted appearance resembling an orange peel (peau d'orange). This is an aggressive form of breast cancer.
    *   **Nipple retraction or inversion that is new.**
    *   **Bone pain, unexplained weight loss, or jaundice:** Suggestive of metastatic breast cancer.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: Z12.31 (Encounter for screening mammogram for malignant neoplasm of breast). Codes for breast lumps, pain, or other symptoms are used when the patient presents with those concerns, not for routine screening.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Screening is primarily based on imaging.
    *   **If a suspicious lesion is found on screening or clinical examination:** Diagnostic mammography, Breast ultrasound, and ultimately Biopsy (fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy) to obtain tissue for histological examination and confirm the diagnosis.

---

### **15. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)**

-   **Symptoms**: A progressive respiratory disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation. Encompasses chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Common symptoms include chronic cough (often productive of sputum), exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath that worsens with activity), and wheezing. Symptoms typically worsen over time. Patients may experience exacerbations, which are acute worsening of respiratory symptoms.
-   **Demographics**: Primarily affects individuals over 40 years old, strongly associated with a history of smoking (current or past). Other risk factors include exposure to occupational dusts and chemicals, indoor air pollution (e.g., biomass fuel smoke), and a genetic deficiency (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency - a less common cause, particularly in younger individuals with COPD). More common in males historically, but prevalence in females is increasing.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on symptom relief, preventing exacerbations, and improving quality of life. There is no cure for COPD.
    *   **Bronchodilators:** Inhaled bronchodilators are central to symptom management.
        *   Short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) (e.g., albuterol) or short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs) (e.g., ipratropium) for as-needed relief of breathlessness.
        *   Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) (e.g., tiotropium, umeclidinium) are used regularly to reduce symptoms and exacerbations in patients with more persistent symptoms.
    *   **Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS):** Often used in combination with LABAs (LABA/ICS inhalers) for patients with frequent exacerbations or more severe disease. Not typically used as monotherapy in COPD.
    *   **Other medications:** Roflumilast (a PDE4 inhibitor for severe COPD with chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations), Azithromycin (as prophylactic therapy in select patients with frequent exacerbations), Supplemental oxygen therapy (for patients with chronic hypoxemia).
    *   **Pulmonary Rehabilitation:** A crucial non-pharmacological intervention to improve exercise tolerance and quality of life.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Asthma (typically has reversible airflow limitation, often with onset in childhood, symptoms vary day-to-day), Heart failure (can cause dyspnea, cough, and wheezing, but usually with signs and symptoms of fluid overload like peripheral edema and orthopnea; chest X-ray and echocardiogram help differentiate), Bronchiectasis (chronic cough with copious purulent sputum, often associated with recurrent infections and characteristic changes on HRCT scan), Tuberculosis, Lung cancer, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (should be considered in younger patients with COPD or those with a family history).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Acute exacerbation of COPD:** Acute worsening of respiratory symptoms (increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence) that requires a change in medication. Severe exacerbations can lead to respiratory failure and require hospitalization.
    *   **Hemoptysis (coughing up blood):** While can occur in severe chronic bronchitis, always warrants investigation to rule out lung cancer or bronchiectasis.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss or new onset of chest pain:** Raises suspicion for underlying lung cancer.
    *   **Significant hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels):** May require hospitalization and supplemental oxygen.
    *   **Signs of right heart failure (cor pulmonale):** Peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly, in the context of severe lung disease.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J44.9 (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified). More specific codes exist for COPD with acute exacerbation or with specific features like emphysema or chronic bronchitis.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Spirometry:** Essential for diagnosis and assessment of severity, demonstrating airflow limitation that is not fully reversible (FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.70 post-bronchodilator).
    *   **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):** To assess for hypoxemia and hypercapnia (elevated CO2), particularly in more severe disease or during exacerbations.
    *   **Chest X-ray:** May show hyperinflation or bullae in emphysema, or thickened bronchial walls in chronic bronchitis. Helpful in ruling out other causes of respiratory symptoms like pneumonia or heart failure.
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** May show polycythemia (increased red blood cell count) in response to chronic hypoxemia.
    *   **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin level:** Should be measured in patients diagnosed with COPD, especially if young, non-smokers, or with a family history of early-onset COPD.

### **16. Asthma**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation, and increased mucus production. Common symptoms include recurrent episodes of wheezing (a whistling sound during breathing, especially exhalation), dyspnea (shortness of breath), chest tightness, and cough (often worse at night or in the early morning, and triggered by exercise, cold air, allergens, or respiratory infections). Symptoms can vary in severity and frequency.
-   **Demographics**: Often begins in childhood but can develop at any age. Frequently associated with a personal or family history of atopy (eczema, allergic rhinitis). Other risk factors include respiratory infections in early life, exposure to allergens, irritants (e.g., smoke), and occupational exposures. Can be more severe and have higher mortality in certain populations.
-   **Medications**: Management focuses on controlling inflammation, relieving bronchoconstriction, preventing exacerbations, and maintaining normal lung function. Treatment is guided by asthma severity and control.
    *   **Reliever Medications:** Short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) (e.g., albuterol) are used for quick relief of asthma symptoms.
    *   **Controller Medications:**
        *   Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide) are the cornerstone of persistent asthma management, reducing airway inflammation.
        *   Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol) are used in combination with ICS for patients whose asthma is not well-controlled on ICS alone (LABA/ICS inhalers). LABAs should not be used as monotherapy in asthma.
        *   Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast) can be used as alternative or add-on therapy, particularly for exercise-induced asthma or allergic rhinitis.
        *   Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) (e.g., tiotropium) may be added for severe asthma.
    *   **Other medications:** Systemic corticosteroids (for moderate to severe exacerbations), Biologics (e.g., omalizumab, mepolizumab - for severe allergic or eosinophilic asthma), Bronchial thermoplasty (procedure for severe, refractory asthma).
    *   **Asthma Action Plan:** A written plan is essential for patients to manage their asthma, including adjusting medications based on symptoms and peak flow readings and recognizing when to seek urgent care.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: COPD (more common in smokers, less reversible airflow limitation), Vocal cord dysfunction (paradoxical movement of the vocal cords during breathing, can mimic asthma, often triggered by exercise or irritants), Heart failure, Bronchiectasis, Pulmonary embolism, Foreign body aspiration (especially in children), Anxiety or panic attacks (can cause shortness of breath and chest tightness, but usually without wheezing or cough).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Status asthmaticus:** A severe, prolonged asthma exacerbation that does not respond to initial bronchodilator therapy. Characterized by severe dyspnea, wheezing (may be absent in very severe obstruction - "silent chest"), use of accessory muscles, difficulty speaking, and often hypoxemia. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment, often in an emergency setting or ICU.
    *   **Hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels):** Indicated by pulse oximetry or ABG. A significant drop in oxygen saturation is a sign of a severe exacerbation.
    *   **Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin or lips):** A late and ominous sign of severe hypoxemia.
    *   **Inability to speak in full sentences due to breathlessness.**
    *   **Decreased level of consciousness or exhaustion.**
    *   **Paradoxical respiration (abdomen moves inward with inspiration):** Indicates severe respiratory muscle fatigue.
    *   **Peak expiratory flow (PEF) significantly below the patient's personal best or predicted value.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J45.909 (Asthma, unspecified, uncomplicated status asthmaticus). More specific codes exist for different types and severity of asthma, and for asthma with exacerbations.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Spirometry:** Essential for diagnosis and monitoring of lung function, demonstrating reversible airflow limitation. May be performed before and after administration of a bronchodilator.
    *   **Peak Flow Monitoring:** Patients can use a peak flow meter at home to monitor their asthma control and detect early signs of worsening.
    *   **Chest X-ray:** Usually normal in uncomplicated asthma but may be done during an exacerbation to rule out complications like pneumonia or pneumothorax.
    *   **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO):** Can be used as a marker of airway inflammation in some cases.
    *   **Allergy testing:** Skin prick testing or specific IgE blood tests can help identify allergic triggers.

### **17. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/CFS or ME/CFS)**

-   **Symptoms**: A complex, debilitating chronic illness characterized by profound fatigue that is not explained by any underlying medical condition. The fatigue is not significantly relieved by rest and is worsened by physical or mental exertion (post-exertional malaise). Other common symptoms include impaired memory or concentration, orthostatic intolerance (worsening symptoms upon standing), unrefreshing sleep, muscle pain, joint pain without swelling or redness, headache, sore throat, and tender lymph nodes. Symptoms must be present for at least six months.
-   **Demographics**: Can affect individuals of any age, but most commonly diagnosed in adults, particularly women, between their 40s and 50s. The exact cause is unknown but may involve a combination of genetic predisposition, infections (viral or bacterial), immune system dysfunction, and stress.
-   **Medications**: There is no specific cure for ME/CFS, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and improving function.
    *   **Symptom Management:** Medications may be used to address specific symptoms such as pain (analgesics), sleep disturbances (sleep hygiene, sometimes sleep medications), orthostatic intolerance (e.g., fludrocortisone, midodrine), and mood disorders (antidepressants if depression is also present).
    *   **Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Historically used, but their role is now debated and GET is not recommended by some guidelines due to the risk of exacerbating post-exertional malaise. Pacing (managing activity levels to avoid post-exertional malaise) is a key strategy.
    *   **Management of comorbidities:** Treating co-occurring conditions like depression, anxiety, sleep apnea, or irritable bowel syndrome is important.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Hypothyroidism, Depression, Anemia, Sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea, narcolepsy), Fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, Mononucleosis, Other chronic infections (e.g., HIV, hepatitis), Autoimmune diseases (e.g., SLE, Sjogren's syndrome), Malignancy, Side effects of medications, Substance abuse. Ruling out other treatable medical conditions is essential before diagnosing ME/CFS.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** While some individuals with ME/CFS may experience weight changes due to altered activity or appetite, significant and unexplained weight loss is a red flag for malignancy or other serious underlying conditions.
    *   **Night sweats:** Can occur in some chronic conditions but also a potential symptom of infection or malignancy.
    *   **Focal neurological deficits:** Weakness, numbness, vision changes, etc., require investigation to rule out neurological diseases.
    *   **Abnormal physical examination findings or laboratory results that suggest an alternative diagnosis.**
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of inflammatory conditions:** Significant joint swelling, persistent high fever.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: R53.82 (Chronic fatigue, unspecified). Note: There is ongoing discussion and debate about the most appropriate coding for ME/CFS.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: No specific diagnostic test for ME/CFS. Laboratory tests are primarily used to rule out other conditions that can cause fatigue.
    *   **Common tests to consider:** Complete Blood Count (CBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (usually normal in ME/CFS, elevated in inflammatory conditions), Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Free T4, Basic metabolic panel (electrolytes, renal function, glucose), Liver function tests, Vitamin D levels, Vitamin B12 levels, Ferritin (iron stores), Urinalysis.
    *   **Other tests as indicated by clinical suspicion:** Lyme serology, HIV test, Hepatitis serology, Autoimmune markers (e.g., ANA) if an autoimmune disease is suspected, Sleep study if a sleep disorder is suspected.

### **18. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**

-   **Symptoms**: A chronic condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms or complications. The most common symptom is heartburn (a burning sensation in the chest, often after eating, that may worsen when lying down or bending over). Other symptoms include regurgitation (bringing up stomach contents into the mouth or throat), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), odynophagia (painful swallowing), chest pain (can mimic cardiac pain), chronic cough, hoarseness, sore throat, and a feeling of a lump in the throat (globus sensation).
-   **Demographics**: Can affect individuals of any age, but more common in adults over 40. Obesity is a major risk factor. Other risk factors include pregnancy, hiatal hernia, smoking, certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics), and certain foods and beverages (e.g., fatty foods, spicy foods, citrus, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol).
-   **Medications**: Management involves lifestyle modifications and medications to reduce stomach acid or improve esophageal motility.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Weight loss, elevating the head of the bed, avoiding trigger foods and beverages, avoiding lying down immediately after eating, avoiding tight clothing.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Antacids (e.g., aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate) provide rapid but short-term relief.
        *   H2 receptor blockers (H2 blockers) (e.g., ranitidine - though largely withdrawn, famotidine, cimetidine) reduce acid production.
        *   Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) (e.g., omeprazole, pantoprazole, esomeprazole) are the most potent acid reducers and are typically the most effective for healing esophagitis and controlling symptoms. Often used as first-line for moderate to severe GERD.
        *   Prokinetics (e.g., metoclopramide - used cautiously due to side effects) can help improve esophageal motility and gastric emptying.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD - can cause epigastric pain that may be relieved or worsened by food, sometimes with heartburn), Esophageal cancer (should be considered in patients with GERD and new or worsening dysphagia, weight loss, or hematemesis), Angina pectoris or other cardiac causes of chest pain (GERD chest pain can mimic cardiac pain, especially if atypical; cardiac evaluation may be necessary), Esophageal spasm, Eosinophilic esophagitis, Gastritis, Gallbladder disease, Hiatal hernia (can be associated with GERD).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing):** Especially if progressive or with solid foods, raises suspicion for esophageal stricture or esophageal cancer.
    *   **Odynophagia (painful swallowing):** Can indicate esophagitis (severe inflammation), infection (e.g., candidiasis), or malignancy.
    *   **Hematemesis (vomiting blood) or Melena (black, tarry stools):** Suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be from severe esophagitis, peptic ulcer, or malignancy.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** A significant red flag for malignancy.
    *   **Iron deficiency anemia:** Can be a sign of chronic blood loss from the GI tract.
    *   **Recurrent vomiting.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: K21.9 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis). K21.0 is used if esophagitis is present.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Further investigations are typically reserved for patients with red-flag symptoms, atypical presentations, or those who do not respond to initial therapy.
    *   **H. pylori testing:** While H. pylori is a common cause of peptic ulcers, its role in GERD is less clear, but testing may be done, especially if PUD is in the differential.
    *   **Upper endoscopy (EGD):** Allows direct visualization of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, enabling assessment for esophagitis, strictures, Barrett's esophagus, ulcers, or malignancy. Biopsies can be taken.
    *   **Esophageal manometry:** Measures esophageal muscle function.
    *   **24-hour esophageal pH monitoring or wireless pH monitoring:** Measures the amount of acid refluxing into the esophagus over a period of time, useful in confirming the diagnosis in unclear cases or evaluating response to treatment.
    *   **Cardiac workup:** May be necessary to rule out cardiac causes of chest pain.

### **19. Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)**

-   **Symptoms**: Characterized by a break in the lining of the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The most common symptom is epigastric pain (pain in the upper abdomen). The character of the pain can vary; it may be burning, gnawing, or aching. Duodenal ulcer pain often improves with eating and worsens several hours after a meal, while gastric ulcer pain may be worsened by eating. Other symptoms can include bloating, early satiety (feeling full quickly), nausea, vomiting, and sometimes heartburn. Some ulcers can be asymptomatic, particularly those caused by NSAID use.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age but more common in adults. The two main causes are infection with *Helicobacter pylori* (*H. pylori*) bacteria and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin. Smoking and stress can also contribute.
-   **Medications**: Treatment focuses on eradicating *H. pylori* (if present), reducing stomach acid, and protecting the ulcer lining to promote healing.
    *   **For *H. pylori* infection:** Triple therapy (typically a PPI, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole) or quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth, metronidazole, tetracycline) are commonly used antibiotic regimens for eradication.
    *   **To reduce acid and promote healing:** Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are highly effective and are a cornerstone of PUD treatment. H2 receptor blockers are also used but are generally less potent than PPIs.
    *   **To protect the ulcer lining:** Sucralfate forms a protective barrier over the ulcer.
    *   **If caused by NSAIDs:** Discontinuation of the NSAID is recommended if possible. If NSAIDs are necessary, co-prescription of a PPI or misoprostol can reduce ulcer risk.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: GERD (overlapping symptoms of heartburn and epigastric pain), Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining, causing epigastric pain, nausea, and bloating), Pancreatic cancer (can cause epigastric pain that radiates to the back, often with weight loss and jaundice in later stages), Gallbladder disease (e.g., cholecystitis, biliary colic - pain typically in the right upper quadrant, often triggered by fatty meals), Non-ulcer dyspepsia (functional dyspepsia - persistent indigestion symptoms without evidence of structural disease), Esophageal spasm, Angina pectoris (chest pain can sometimes radiate to the epigastrium).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Hematemesis (vomiting blood) or "coffee-ground" emesis:** Indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
    *   **Melena (black, tarry stools):** Indicates bleeding in the upper GI tract.
    *   **Hematochezia (bright red blood in the stool):** Usually indicates lower GI bleeding, but can occur with massive upper GI bleeding.
    *   **Severe, sudden, sharp abdominal pain that is constant and worsens with movement:** Suggests ulcer perforation, a surgical emergency.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** Raises suspicion for gastric cancer (which can present as an ulcer) or pancreatic cancer.
    *   **Persistent vomiting:** May indicate gastric outlet obstruction due to ulcer swelling or scarring.
    *   **Anemia (iron deficiency) due to chronic blood loss.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: K27.9 (Peptic ulcer, site unspecified, unspecified as acute or chronic, without hemorrhage or perforation). More specific codes exist for gastric or duodenal ulcers, acuity, and presence of hemorrhage or perforation.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   ***H. pylori* testing:** Recommended in all patients with active PUD or a history of PUD. Tests include urea breath test, stool antigen test, or biopsy during endoscopy.
    *   **Upper endoscopy (EGD):** The gold standard for diagnosing PUD, allowing direct visualization of the ulcer, biopsy for *H. pylori* and to rule out malignancy (especially in gastric ulcers), and treatment of bleeding ulcers.
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia due to chronic blood loss.
    *   **Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or Fecal immunochemical test (FIT):** To detect occult blood in the stool.
    *   **Serum gastrin levels:** May be measured if Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (a rare condition causing excessive acid production and refractory ulcers) is suspected.

### **20. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**

-   **Symptoms**: A common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or alternating between the two) without evidence of structural or biochemical abnormalities. Symptoms often include abdominal pain or discomfort that is related to defecation or associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Bloating and abdominal distension are also common. IBS is classified into subtypes based on the predominant bowel habit: IBS-D (diarrhea-predominant), IBS-C (constipation-predominant), and IBS-M (mixed bowel habits).
-   **Demographics**: Typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, with onset usually before age 50. More commonly diagnosed in females than males, with a ratio of approximately 2:1. Stress and psychological factors can exacerbate symptoms.
-   **Medications**: Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms and is often multimodal.
    *   **Dietary modifications:** Identifying and avoiding trigger foods (e.g., high-FODMAP foods, dairy, gluten) can be helpful for some patients. Regular meal times and adequate fluid intake are important.
    *   **Medications for abdominal pain:** Antispasmodics (e.g., dicyclomine, hyoscyamine) can help with abdominal cramps. Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or SSRIs may be effective for pain and overall IBS symptoms, particularly in IBS-D.
    *   **Medications for constipation (IBS-C):** Fiber supplements, osmotic laxatives (e.g., polyethylene glycol), lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide.
    *   **Medications for diarrhea (IBS-D):** Loperamide (an antimotility agent), rifaximin (a non-absorbable antibiotic), eluxadoline.
    *   **Other therapies:** Peppermint oil, probiotics (evidence varies), psychological therapies (e.g., CBT, hypnotherapy).
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD - Crohn's disease or Ulcerative colitis; characterized by chronic inflammation of the GI tract, often with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and systemic symptoms), Celiac disease (autoimmune reaction to gluten, causing diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and malabsorption), Microscopic colitis (chronic watery diarrhea), Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO - can cause bloating, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habits), Lactose intolerance, Ovarian cancer (can present with bloating and abdominal discomfort, particularly in older women), Colon cancer (less likely to present solely with IBS-like symptoms, but should be considered, especially with red flags), Thyroid dysfunction, Giardiasis or other parasitic infections, Bile acid malabsorption.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Hematochezia (bright red blood in the stool):** Not a typical symptom of IBS and warrants investigation to rule out IBD, diverticulosis, polyps, or malignancy.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss:** A significant red flag for IBD, malignancy, or malabsorption.
    *   **Anemia (iron deficiency):** Suggests chronic blood loss, even if not visible.
    *   **Onset of symptoms in older age (e.g., over 50):** While IBS can be diagnosed in older adults, new onset of bowel symptoms in this age group warrants a thorough evaluation to exclude malignancy.
    *   **Nocturnal diarrhea:** Diarrhea that wakes the patient from sleep is generally not a feature of IBS and suggests an organic cause.
    *   **Fever, severe or progressive abdominal pain, or signs of malabsorption.**
    *   **Family history of colon cancer or IBD.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: K58.9 (Irritable bowel syndrome without diarrhea). K58.0 is used for IBS with diarrhea.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: No specific diagnostic test for IBS. Investigations are primarily performed to rule out other conditions.
    *   **Common tests to rule out other conditions:** Complete Blood Count (CBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (usually normal in IBS, elevated in IBD), Celiac serology (e.g., tissue transglutaminase IgA), Stool studies (for infection, occult blood, calprotectin), Thyroid function tests.
    *   **Further investigations as indicated by red flags or clinical suspicion:** Colonoscopy (especially for patients over 50, with red flags, or family history), Upper endoscopy, Imaging studies (e.g., CT scan), hydrogen breath test (for SIBO).

### **21. Allergic Rhinitis**

-   **Symptoms**: An inflammatory condition of the nasal passages triggered by allergens. Symptoms include sneezing (often in paroxysms), rhinorrhea (clear, watery nasal discharge), nasal congestion or stuffiness, and pruritus (itching) of the nose, eyes, throat, or ears. Ocular symptoms like itchy, red, watery eyes are common (allergic conjunctivitis). Symptoms can be seasonal (triggered by pollen) or perennial (triggered by allergens like dust mites, pet dander, mold).
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages, commonly starting in childhood or adolescence. Often associated with a personal or family history of other atopic diseases (asthma, eczema, food allergies). Prevalence is high globally.
-   **Medications**: Management involves allergen avoidance and medications to reduce inflammation and symptoms.
    *   **Allergen Avoidance:** Strategies depend on the specific allergens (e.g., using air filters, washing bedding frequently, avoiding outdoor exposure during high pollen counts).
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Intranasal corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone) are highly effective for controlling nasal symptoms and are often considered first-line for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis.
        *   Oral or intranasal antihistamines (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine - less sedating; diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine - more sedating) help with sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea.
        *   Oral or topical decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline) can help with nasal congestion (topical decongestants should be used short-term to avoid rebound congestion).
        *   Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast) can be effective, particularly for patients with concomitant asthma or if other therapies are insufficient.
        *   Nasal saline irrigation helps clear nasal passages.
    *   **Immunotherapy (Allergy Shots or Sublingual Immunotherapy):** Can be considered for patients with persistent or severe symptoms not controlled by medications, or those who wish to reduce long-term medication use. Involves gradually exposing the individual to increasing amounts of the allergen to build tolerance.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Viral rhinitis (common cold - typically acute onset, often with sore throat, cough, and low-grade fever; symptoms usually resolve within a week or two), Non-allergic rhinitis (symptoms similar to allergic rhinitis but not triggered by allergens, can be vasomotor, irritant-induced, etc.), Sinusitis (can occur as a complication of allergic rhinitis, persistent nasal congestion, facial pain, sometimes fever), Rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound nasal congestion from overuse of topical decongestants), Structural nasal abnormalities (e.g., deviated septum, nasal polyps).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Nasal polyps causing significant obstruction or anosmia (loss of smell):** May require ENT referral for evaluation and management.
    *   **Unilateral nasal symptoms (discharge, obstruction, pain):** While allergic rhinitis is typically bilateral, unilateral symptoms warrant investigation to rule out foreign body (especially in children), tumor, or other structural issues.
    *   **Severe facial pain or swelling, high fever, vision changes:** Suggests complications like acute bacterial sinusitis with potential extension or orbital cellulitis.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of chronic rhinosinusitis:** Nasal congestion, facial pain/pressure, reduced sense of smell lasting for 12 weeks or longer.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: J30.9 (Allergic rhinitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history.
    *   **Allergy testing:** Skin prick testing or serum-specific IgE testing can identify the specific allergens triggering symptoms and are helpful in confirming the diagnosis, guiding allergen avoidance, and considering immunotherapy.

### **22. Gastroenteritis**

-   **Symptoms**: Acute inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines, commonly caused by viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections ("stomach bug" or "stomach flu," though not related to influenza). Key symptoms include diarrhea (often watery), vomiting, abdominal cramps and pain, nausea, and sometimes low-grade fever, headache, and myalgias. Symptoms typically have a sudden onset and are often self-limiting.
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages. Viral gastroenteritis is highly contagious and can occur in outbreaks, particularly in closed settings like schools or cruise ships. Rotavirus was a common cause in young children before widespread vaccination. Norovirus is a frequent cause of outbreaks in adults. Bacterial gastroenteritis can be caused by contaminated food or water.
-   **Medications**: Treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on preventing dehydration. Antibiotics are generally not used for viral gastroenteritis and are reserved for specific bacterial infections or parasitic infections.
    *   **Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT):** The cornerstone of management, involving drinking fluids with electrolytes (e.g., oral rehydration solutions) to replace lost fluids and salts. Especially important in children and the elderly who are at higher risk of dehydration.
    *   **Antimotility agents (e.g., loperamide):** Can help reduce diarrhea in adults but should be avoided in cases of suspected bacterial dysentery (bloody diarrhea with fever) as they can prolong the infection. Generally not recommended in young children.
    *   **Antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron):** May be used to help control vomiting, particularly in cases where it interferes with oral rehydration.
    *   **Antibiotics:** Only prescribed for specific bacterial pathogens (e.g., *C. difficile*, severe traveler's diarrhea, giardiasis) identified by stool testing or strongly suspected clinically.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Food poisoning (rapid onset of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after consuming contaminated food, often caused by bacterial toxins), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD - can present with diarrhea and abdominal pain, but typically chronic with other symptoms like bloody stool and weight loss), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS - chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, not typically acute onset with vomiting), Diverticulitis, Appendicitis (can initially present with abdominal pain that may be diffuse before localizing, nausea, and vomiting), Ischemic colitis, Medication side effects.
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Signs of severe dehydration:** Sunken eyes, decreased urination, lethargy, dizziness, dry mouth and tongue, rapid heart rate. Requires intravenous fluid rehydration, often in a hospital setting.
    *   **Hematochezia (visible blood in the stool):** Suggests an inflammatory or infectious process that may require specific treatment and investigation (e.g., bacterial dysentery, IBD).
    *   **High fever (e.g., >38.5°C or 101.3°F):** More common in bacterial infections.
    *   **Severe, localized abdominal pain:** May indicate a surgical issue like appendicitis or diverticulitis.
    *   **Persistent vomiting that prevents oral fluid intake.**
    *   **Diarrhea lasting longer than several days (e.g., >7 days):** Warrants investigation for less common causes or complications.
    *   **Symptoms in immunocompromised individuals or those with significant comorbidities:** Higher risk of severe or complicated illness.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: K52.9 (Noninfective gastroenteritis and colitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for infective gastroenteritis if the pathogen is identified (e.g., specific viral or bacterial codes).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Laboratory tests are usually not necessary for mild, self-limiting cases.
    *   **Stool studies:** May be performed in cases of severe illness, bloody diarrhea, high fever, symptoms lasting longer than several days, immunocompromise, or suspected outbreak. Tests include stool culture (for bacterial pathogens like Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli), stool PCR (multiplex panels can detect a variety of viruses, bacteria, and parasites), and *C. difficile* toxin testing (if there is a history of antibiotic use).
    *   **Basic metabolic panel:** To assess for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, particularly in severe cases.

---

### **23. Mononucleosis (Infectious Mononucleosis)**

-   **Symptoms**: An infectious disease most commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Often referred to as "the kissing disease" because it is spread through saliva. Symptoms typically include fever, severe sore throat (often with exudates), and swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), particularly in the neck (posterior cervical). Other common symptoms include fatigue, malaise, headache, muscle aches, and sometimes a rash. Splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen) and hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver) can occur. Symptoms can last for several weeks or even months, particularly the fatigue.
-   **Demographics**: Most commonly affects adolescents and young adults. Infection in young children is often asymptomatic or presents as a mild, non-specific illness.
-   **Medications**: Treatment is primarily supportive, as it is a viral infection. Antibiotics are ineffective.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Rest, hydration, and over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) for fever and pain.
    *   **Corticosteroids:** May be used in select cases for complications such as significant airway obstruction due to swollen tonsils or severe thrombocytopenia or anemia.
    *   **Antiviral medications:** While EBV is a virus, antiviral medications are generally not recommended for uncomplicated infectious mononucleosis.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat - bacterial infection with sore throat, fever, and lymphadenopathy, but typically without the prolonged fatigue or splenomegaly of mono), CMV infection (Cytomegalovirus - another virus that can cause a mononucleosis-like illness, particularly in immunocompromised individuals), Toxoplasmosis (parasitic infection that can cause fever and lymphadenopathy), Acute HIV infection (can present with fever, rash, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy), Viral pharyngitis (other viruses causing sore throat), Lymphoma (though less likely with acute onset and typical symptoms).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Significant splenomegaly with left upper quadrant pain:** Indicates a risk of splenic rupture, particularly with trauma or strenuous activity. Patients should avoid contact sports and heavy lifting for several weeks to months until the spleen returns to normal size.
    *   **Airway compromise:** Severe tonsillar enlargement can obstruct the airway, requiring urgent medical intervention and potentially corticosteroids.
    *   **Neurological complications:** Rare but can occur, such as encephalitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome.
    *   **Severe thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or hemolytic anemia:** Can occur in some cases and may require treatment.
    *   **Jaundice or significant right upper quadrant pain:** May indicate significant hepatitis.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: B27.90 (Infectious mononucleosis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for infectious mononucleosis with specific complications (e.g., with hepatitis, with meningitis).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**:
    *   **Heterophile antibody test (Monospot test):** A common initial test that detects heterophile antibodies produced during EBV infection. It is relatively specific but may be negative early in the illness, particularly in young children.
    *   **EBV serology:** If the Monospot test is negative or the diagnosis is uncertain, specific EBV antibody tests (e.g., viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM and IgG, EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG) can help confirm the diagnosis and determine the stage of infection.
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential:** May show a characteristic lymphocytosis (increased number of lymphocytes), often with atypical lymphocytes. Mild thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) are also common.

---

### **24. Conjunctivitis**

-   **Symptoms**: Inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids. Commonly known as "pink eye." Symptoms include redness of the conjunctiva, discharge (watery, mucoid, or purulent), itching, burning or gritty sensation in the eye, mild photophobia (sensitivity to light), and sometimes eyelid swelling. Vision is typically normal. Can affect one or both eyes.
-   **Demographics**: Affects individuals of all ages. Highly contagious viral conjunctivitis is a common cause of outbreaks, especially in schools and crowded settings. Bacterial conjunctivitis is also common, particularly in children. Allergic conjunctivitis is often seen in individuals with other allergies and can be seasonal or perennial.
-   **Medications**: Treatment depends on the cause (viral, bacterial, allergic).
    *   **Viral Conjunctivitis:** Most common cause, often associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Treatment is supportive: artificial tears, cold compresses. Highly contagious - emphasize hygiene (handwashing, avoiding sharing towels).
    *   **Bacterial Conjunctivitis:** More common in children, often with thicker, purulent (pus-like) discharge. Treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointment (e.g., erythromycin, sulfacetamide, fluoroquinolones).
    *   **Allergic Conjunctivitis:** Often bilateral, with prominent itching and watery discharge. Treatment includes identifying and avoiding allergens, artificial tears, topical antihistamines (e.g., olopatadine, azelastine), topical mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromolyn), or topical NSAIDs. Topical corticosteroids may be used for severe cases under ophthalmologist supervision.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Allergic conjunctivitis (prominent itching, often with other allergy symptoms), Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea - usually more severe pain, photophobia, and vision changes), Uveitis (inflammation of the uvea - pain, photophobia, decreased vision, ciliary flush around the iris), Scleritis (inflammation of the sclera - severe pain, intense redness), Acute angle-closure glaucoma (severe eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, vomiting, fixed dilated pupil - a medical emergency), Foreign body in the eye, Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Severe eye pain:** Conjunctivitis is usually associated with discomfort or a gritty sensation, not severe pain. Severe pain suggests involvement of the cornea, iris, or other deeper structures.
    *   **Vision changes (decreased visual acuity, blurred vision):** Conjunctivitis should not significantly affect vision. Vision changes are a red flag for keratitis, uveitis, or other more serious conditions.
    *   **Significant photophobia (severe sensitivity to light):** Can indicate inflammation within the eye (e.g., uveitis) or corneal involvement.
    *   **Ciliary flush:** Redness concentrated in a ring around the iris, suggestive of uveitis or keratitis.
    *   **Corneal opacity or ulceration visible on examination.**
    *   **Pupil abnormalities (size, shape, reactivity):** Can indicate serious ocular or neurological issues.
    *   **Proptosis (protrusion of the eyeball) or limited eye movements:** Suggests orbital involvement.
-   **ICD-10 Code**: H10.9 (Conjunctivitis, unspecified). More specific codes exist for different types of conjunctivitis (e.g., viral, bacterial, allergic) and laterality (right eye, left eye, bilateral).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Laboratory tests are generally not necessary for typical cases.
    *   **Conjunctival swab for culture and sensitivity:** May be indicated for severe or recurrent bacterial conjunctivitis, in immunocompromised patients, or if there is suspicion of a less common pathogen (e.g., Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae - in which case rapid referral is needed).

---

### **25. Headaches (Tension-Type)**

-   **Symptoms**: The most common type of headache. Typically described as a bilateral, non-pulsatile, mild to moderate pressure or tightness sensation, often described as feeling like a band around the head. Usually does not worsen with physical activity. May be accompanied by tenderness of the scalp, neck, and shoulder muscles. Nausea and vomiting are usually absent, although mild photophobia or phonophobia may occur (but not both as typically seen in migraine). Can be episodic or chronic (occurring frequently).
-   **Demographics**: Very common, affecting a large proportion of the population at some point in their lives. More prevalent in females than males, with onset often in young adulthood (age 30-50 peak). Stress, poor posture, and muscle tension can contribute.
-   **Medications**: Treatment involves both acute treatment for individual headaches and preventive treatment for frequent or debilitating headaches.
    *   **Acute Treatment:** Over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen) are often effective. Combination analgesics (e.g., with caffeine) can also be used.
    *   **Preventive Treatment (for chronic or frequent episodic tension-type headaches):** Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) are often considered first-line for prevention. Other options may include other antidepressants or muscle relaxants.
    *   **Non-pharmacological therapies:** Stress management techniques, biofeedback, physical therapy, massage, and acupuncture can be helpful.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Migraine (typically unilateral, pulsating, moderate to severe pain, often with nausea/vomiting and photophobia/phonophobia), Cluster headache (severe, unilateral, orbital or periorbital pain, occurring in clusters, with autonomic symptoms), Secondary headaches (headaches caused by underlying medical conditions).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**: It is crucial to differentiate tension-type headaches from more serious secondary causes of headache.
    *   **Thunderclap headache:** Sudden, severe headache reaching maximum intensity within seconds to minutes. **Medical emergency.**
    *   **Headache with focal neurological deficits:** New onset of weakness, numbness, speech difficulties, vision loss, etc. **Requires urgent investigation.**
    *   **Headache with fever, neck stiffness, or rash:** Suggests meningitis or encephalitis.
    *   **Headache that is new or different, especially in a patient with a history of cancer or immunocompromise.**
    *   **Headache that worsens with coughing, straining, or changes in position.**
    *   **Headache with papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve head).**
    *   **New onset headache in a patient over 50 years old, especially if associated with jaw claudication or visual symptoms:** Could indicate giant cell arteritis.
    *   **Headache following head trauma.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: G44.209 (Tension-type headache, unspecified, not intractable). More specific codes exist for episodic or chronic tension-type headaches and intractability.
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis. Neuroimaging (CT or MRI of the head) is generally not needed for typical tension-type headaches but is indicated if any red-flag symptoms are present or if the diagnosis is uncertain.
    *   **May consider:** ESR (if giant cell arteritis is suspected in older patients).

---

### **26. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

-   **Symptoms**: Characterized by excessive worry and anxiety about various events or activities that is difficult to control and occurs on most days for at least six months. The worry is often accompanied by at least three of the following symptoms: restlessness or feeling on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep). The anxiety and worry cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
-   **Demographics**: Can occur at any age, but onset is often in late adolescence or early adulthood (age 30-50 peak). More common in females than males. Family history may increase risk. Stressful life events can trigger or worsen GAD.
-   **Medications**: Treatment often involves a combination of psychotherapy and medications.
    *   **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective form of therapy for GAD, helping individuals identify and challenge anxious thoughts and develop coping strategies.
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine) are often considered first-line pharmacological treatment.
        *   Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine) are also effective.
        *   Buspirone is an alternative medication that can be helpful for anxiety symptoms, particularly worry.
        *   Benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, lorazepam) may be used for short-term relief of acute, severe anxiety but are generally avoided for long-term treatment due to the risk of dependence and withdrawal.
-   **Differential Diagnoses**: Hyperthyroidism (can cause anxiety, restlessness, palpitations), Panic disorder (characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks), Social anxiety disorder (anxiety specifically in social situations), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD - characterized by obsessions and compulsions), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD - anxiety symptoms triggered by a traumatic event), Specific phobias, Medication side effects (e.g., stimulants, corticosteroids), Substance use or withdrawal, Other medical conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, pheochromocytoma).
-   **Red-Flag Symptoms**:
    *   **Suicidal ideation or intent:** While anxiety disorders increase the risk of suicidality, any thoughts of self-harm require immediate assessment and intervention.
    *   **Panic attacks with atypical symptoms (e.g., chest pain radiating to the arm, significant shortness of breath not relieved by hyperventilation):** While panic attacks can mimic medical emergencies, atypical presentations warrant investigation to rule out cardiac or pulmonary causes.
    *   **Symptoms suggestive of a medical cause:** New onset anxiety with significant physical symptoms like palpitations, tremors, weight loss (suggesting hyperthyroidism), or episodic symptoms (suggesting pheochromocytoma).
    *   **Psychosis (hallucinations or delusions):** Not typical of GAD and suggests a different psychiatric disorder.
    *   **Significant impairment in functioning that is rapidly worsening.**
-   **ICD-10 Code**: F41.1 (Generalized anxiety disorder).
-   **Laboratory Investigations**: Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history and mental status examination. Laboratory tests are mainly used to rule out other medical conditions that can mimic anxiety.
    *   **Common tests to consider:** Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) (to rule out hyperthyroidism), Complete Blood Count (CBC), Basic metabolic panel (electrolytes, glucose), Liver function tests.
    *   **Other tests as indicated:** Electrocardiogram (EKG) (if cardiac symptoms are prominent), Toxicology screen (if substance use is suspected), potentially further endocrine testing if a hormonal cause is suspected.
